# Configuration Options

The UI5 test suite module contains the configuration for the UI5 test suite.



<a name="loio738ed025b36e484fa99046d0f80552fd__section_vyx_hpm_sdc"/>

## **Available Options and Default Values**

The following options are available on the `defaults` and the individual test configuration objects:

> ### Note:  
> The values used in the following code are the default values and are used as a fallback for options that are not defined in the configuration file - neither in the `defaults` object, nor in an individual test configuration object.
