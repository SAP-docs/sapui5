**Code Coverage Powered by `Istanbul`**

SAPUI5 already provides a deep integration of `QUnit` and code coverage measurement. We now introduce `Istanbul` as a modern JavaScript code instrumenter, which is intended to eventually replace the former, now legacy solution based on `Blanket.js`.

To start taking advantage of the more future-proof and feature-rich `Istanbul` solution, see the updated [code coverage documentation](../04_Essentials/code-coverage-measurement-7ef3242.md).

**SAPUI5 Date and Time Formatting**

The new version of SAPUI5 introduces the following formatting features:

-   You can now centrally configure calendar week numbering via the new `calendarWeekNumbering` configuration parameter. Note that the `calendarWeekNumbering` format option introduced with SAPUI5 1.108 for `sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat` overrules the central configuration.

    For more information, see [Configuration Options and URL Parameters](../04_Essentials/configuration-options-and-url-parameters-91f2d03.md).

-   We provide the new `intervalDelimiter` format option for `sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat`. If an `intervalDelimiter` is set, the locale-specific rules for displaying a range as defined in the Common Locale Data Repository are overruled; the two parts of the range are formatted individually, and the given delimiter is used.

**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model**

The new version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model introduces the following features:

-   You can now delete nested transient records that were created using the experimental Deep Create feature provided with SAPUI5 1.112. Any initial data handed over to `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding#create` can now contain nested entities.

    For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding/methods/create).

-   In read-only scenarios, you can now combine the experimental hierarchy feature introduced with SAPUI5 1.105 with the `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#setKeepAlive` and `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel#getKeepAliveContext` data synchronization methods described in [Data Reuse](../04_Essentials/data-reuse-648e360.md).

    For more information, see the API Reference for [`setKeepAlive`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context/methods/setKeepAlive) and [`getKeepAliveContext`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel/methods/getKeepAliveContext).

-   The `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#resetChanges` API introduced as an experimental feature with SAPUI5 1.109 is now generally available.

    For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context/methods/resetChanges).

You can now prevent the activation of a new inactive entity by using `sap.ui.base.Event#preventDefault` in the handler of the `createActivate` event of an `sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataListBinding`. Note that user input into inactive rows is regarded as a pending change by `sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel#hasPendingChanges`; it can be reset using `sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel#resetChanges`.

For more information, see the API Reference for [`hasPendingChanges`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel/methods/hasPendingChanges), [`resetChanges`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel/methods/resetChanges), and [`Event.preventDefault`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.base.Event/methods/preventDefault).

**SAP Fiori elements for OData V2**

The following changes and new features are available for SAP Fiori elements for OData V2:

-   We now show the subtitle and the app icon in the navigation menu as defined in the application's manifest. For more information, see [Checking Folder Structure and Project Artifacts](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/checking-folder-structure-and-project-artifacts-f7abd1b.md).

-   We've improved the data entry experience in draft-enabled SAP Fiori elements apps to make it less disruptive for users.

    SAP Fiori elements no longer requests state messages with every `MERGE` request, resulting in fewer error messages on the UI. Messages are now fetched when a `GET` request is resolved in the following scenarios:

    -   Validation \(a user triggers the request using the [Enter\] key or the *Validate* button\)

    -   Finalizing actions \(a user triggers the request using the *Save* or *Create* button\)

    -   Creation of an object

    -   Update of fields configured with side effects

    -   Update of multi-input fields


    This improvement affects `MERGE` requests such as the following use cases:

    -   Update of a draft \(a user updates data in a field of a draft object\)

    -   Creation of an item in a table on an object page

    -   Update of data from custom facets or reusable components that are merged via `MERGE` requests from the framework

**SAP Fiori elements for OData V4**

The following changes and new features are available for SAP Fiori elements for OData V4:

-   You can now show and hide tables in object page reference facets. For more information, see [Showing and Hiding Content in Object Page Facets](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/showing-and-hiding-content-in-object-page-facets-9fcea86.md).

-   The sorting mechanism and options on a table column now reflect the visible properties and content of the column. Note that in SAP Fiori apps that were built using ABAP CDS, sort restrictions may apply.

    ![](images/Sorting_Column_Content_-_Improved_68e1849.png)

-   When no `QuickView` annotations are defined and no target is resolved at runtime, the field now appears as a link and a message is displayed when you click the link. For more information, see [Configuring the Content of Quick Views](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/configuring-the-content-of-quick-views-c245ad7.md).

**`sap.ui.integration.widgets.Card`**

-   Using the new `customStateIcon` property, you can now set custom state-icons for the items in Table, List, and Object cards. Before this change, states like `Error`, `Warning`, `Success`, or `Information`, only had default icons. For more information, see the [Table Card](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/typesDeclarative/table) section and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/table/visibleColumns) in the Card Explorer.

-   Integration cards now support the `IllustratedMessage` control to provide more informative and consistent error messages. When the application is in debug mode \(when the URL parameter `sap-ui-debug=true` is set\), the *Show More* button opens a dialog with relevant additional \(more technical\) information.

-   We have enhanced the Table card with several new properties:

    -   You can use the new `highlight` property to show the state of each table row. Additionally, the `highlightText` property conveys the semantic of this state for better accessibility.
    -   The `additionalText` property gives you the option to display additional text in the table identifier column.

    For more information, see the [Table Card](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/typesDeclarative/table) section and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/table/highlight) in the Card Explorer.

-   The control now supports the `Common.IsTimezone` annotation that indicates whether a given property of type `Edm.String` is a time zone.

-   We have enhanced the support of the `FieldControl` annotation `<Annotation Term="Common.FieldControl" EnumMember="Common.FieldControlType/Optional"/>`. Because its default value is `Optional` and that's why it usually isn't explicitly defined by the services. Until now, this behavior was controlled by the property\`s `Nullable` annotation \(`Nullable=false` was regarded as mandatory\). Now we respect this enum member, whenever it\`s defined, and in cases when there is a `FieldControl` annotation defined with value `Optional`, we take it into account and do not indicate the field as mandatory.
