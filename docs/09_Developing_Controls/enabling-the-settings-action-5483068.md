# Enabling the *Settings* Action

This section shows an example how to enable enable a control for the *settings* action.

Using SAPUI5 flexibility, you can change the settings of a control. You can register a *settings* action, which adds the *Settings* option to the context menu and allows for calling a handler that defines the control-specific UI and handles its changes.

The *settings* action can be defined as a single action \(= one handler + one context menu item called *Settings*\) or as a list of actions \(= multiple handlers + multiple context menu items with custom names\).
