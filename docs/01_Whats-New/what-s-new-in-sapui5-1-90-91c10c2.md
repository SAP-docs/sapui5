**`sap.m.NotificationList`**

The control provides a container for `sap.m.NotificationListGroup` and `sap.m.NotificationListItem` items where this control should be used, instead of `sap.m.List`. While the `sap.m.List` is still working properly, we strongly recommend you to use the new `sap.m.NotificationList` control in order to benefit from the accessibility features that are built-in. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.NotificationList).

**Key User Adaptation: Local Reset of Controls**

In UI adaptation mode, key users can now remove all key user changes for specific controls by using the new *Reset Container* action. Previously, key users had to either manually undo individual UI changes or reset all UI changes for the entire app. This new local reset is currently supported for the following controls: `Form`, `SimpleForm`, `SmartForm`.

> ### Restriction:  
> This feature is currently not available on SAP BTP.

**UI Adaptation Support for OData V2 `SmartVariantManagement` Controls**

Key users can now use the `sap.ui.comp.smartvariants.SmartVariantManagement` control to save variants \(or "views"\) for end users. On the SAPUI5 side, this works out of the box for any app that is enabled for UI adaptation, but you may need to update your back-end system. For more information, see [Key User Adaptation](../10_More_About_Controls/key-user-adaptation-2e6920b.md) and [SAPUI5 Flexibility: Enable Your App for UI Adaptation](../05_Developing_Apps/sapui5-flexibility-enable-your-app-for-ui-adaptation-f1430c0.md).

On the design-time side, this type of variant is ready to be implemented in SAP's design-time environments \(SAP Business Application Studio, SAP Fiori tools\).

The operators dropdown is disabled for fields of `Boolean` type and in the *Define Conditions* tab of the `ValueHelpDialog`.

**`sap.f.IllustratedMessage` \(Experimental\)**

We have implemented two new samples for specific scenarios:

-   The first sample is useful for apps that have user sign in and use a mechanism for automated sign out as a result of inactivity over a predefined period of time. The period of inactivity can vary between 5 to 60 minutes. A session timeout dialog appears automatically to inform the user.For more information, see the [sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.f.IllustratedMessage/sample/sap.f.sample.IllustratedMessageSessionTimeout).

-   The second sample demonstrates the TNT Illustration Set where you can preview the illustration types in the different illustration sizes.For more information, see the [sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.f.IllustratedMessage/sample/sap.f.sample.IllustratedMessageInPageTNT).

Now, application developers can choose whether to display the overflow tabs at the `End` \(default\) of the Icon Tab Bar, or alternatively at `StartAndEnd` - with two overflows on both ends of the bar. Usage of the property with `StartAndEnd` value is recommended for scenarios, where the order of the tabs is important; for example, when the tabs represent process steps. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.IconTabBar) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.m.IconTabBar/sample/sap.m.sample.IconTabBarStartAndEndOverflow).

**`sap.ui.integration.widgets.Card`**

-   Integration cards now support \(in experimental state\) OData batch requests, which are sent using the HTTP POST method. This enables application developers to describe such requests in the manifest file, in an extension, or in a Component card. This feature allows a single HTTP POST \(batch\) request to be sent to both OData V2 and V4 services, which improves the performance. For more information, see the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/data/batchRequest) and the [Data Handling](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/features/data) section in the Card Explorer.

-   We have introduced \(in experimental state\) a new type of Integration card – the WebPage card. It allows you to embed an HTML page inside the content of the card. For more information, see the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/webPage) and the [WebPage Card](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/types/webPage) section in the Card Explorer.
