# Views

The view in the Model-View-Controller \(MVC\) concept is responsible for defining and rendering the UI. SAPUI5 supports predefined view types.

The following predefined view types are available:

-   **XML view**, a file or string in XML format

-   **Typed view**, constructed in a programmatic manner


> ### Note:  
> We recommend using XML views unless you need the dynamics possible by the programmatic nature of Typed Views. The declarative approach used by XML views comes with many benefits; for example, the code is often more readable and easier to support.
> 
> Throughout this documentation, the code examples mainly use XML views.
