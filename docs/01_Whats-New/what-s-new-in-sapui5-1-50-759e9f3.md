**New Demo Kit \(already available as of version 1.48.5\)**

The Demo Kit app has a new modern design that is intuitive and can be used on both desktop and mobile devices.

The global search has been improved and the results are now displayed in categories. They also include results from the *Samples* section, which was not possible with the old Demo Kit since the *Explored* app was a decoupled app.

The new Demo Kit contains the following sections:

-   Landing page with getting started information

-   *Documentation* with detailed information

-   *API Reference* with JavaScript documentation about the framework and the UI controls, including details for the corresponding properties, aggregations, associations, events, and methods

-   *Samples*, showcasing almost all controls with ability to download the sample code

-   *Demo Apps*, showcasing real-life scenarios that can easily be downloaded

**Unicode Common Locale Data Repository \(CLDR\)**

The Unicode Common Locale Data Repository \(CLDR\) has been updated to version 31.

The correct plural category for a given number is now handled by the locale-specific plural rules offered by CLDR. Different languages use different plural forms, some languages have only singular and plural, others require additional forms, for example, dual \(two\), paucal \(few\), or many.

**Date Interval Types**

<td valign="top">

**Date Interval Types**

Date interval types are introduced to format two date-related properties from a model for displaying in the UI. Additionally they are used to parse and validate the values in UI controls before they are saved back to the model. The new interval types are:

-   `sap.ui.model.type.DateInterval` - a date interval \(without time\)

-   `sap.ui.model.type.DateTimeInterval` - a date interval with the exact point of time

-   `sap.ui.model.type.TimeInterval` - a time interval \(without date\)


For more information, see [sap.ui.model.type.DateTimeInterval](../04_Essentials/sap-ui-model-type-datetimeinterval-94658aa.md) and the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.type).

The configuration option `animationMode` replaces `animation`, which is now deprecated. The new option supports several states \(`full`, `basic`, `minimal`, `none`\), which allow controls to extend support for animations in a more granular way instead of a binary `on`/`off` state. For more information, see [Configuration Options and URL Parameters](../04_Essentials/configuration-options-and-url-parameters-91f2d03.md), [Implementing Animation Modes](../09_Developing_Controls/implementing-animation-modes-76b7d50.md), and the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.Configuration.AnimationMode).

**`sap.suite.ui.commons.networkgraph`**

**`sap.suite.ui.commons.networkgraph`**

You can use this control to visualize data as a graph that illustrates how individual records are related. Displaying data as a network graph may also help you to highlight some of the data discrepancies that might be overlooked when the same data is displayed as a list or any other form of text.

The network graph supports both directed and undirected graphs and even graphs that contain cycles. The control provides broad customization options, enabling you to separate the graph layout from its rendering and to position individual graph elements freely, for example, when displaying geospatial data on top of a map.

For more information, see [Network Graph](../10_More_About_Controls/network-graph-b5649c8.md), the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.suite.ui.commons.networkgraph) and the [samples](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.suite.ui.commons.networkgraph.Graph).

**`sap.suite.ui.commons.statusindicator`**

You can use the `StatusIndicator` control to display a percentage value in the form of a fillable shape, translating plain numbers into meaningful shapes that visually convey the status of the items they represent.

You can fully customize the control by setting fill direction and fill color and by picking a shape that matches the value measured. In addition to the library of standard shapes, you can define your own custom SVG shapes. This allows you to create a powerful connection between your data and business by using symbols from a particular domain—for example, a half-filled truck shape may represent a real delivery truck filled up to 50% of its capacity.

The status indicator is best used in tiles, tables, and object pages.

For more information, see [Status Indicator](../10_More_About_Controls/status-indicator-8d5664a.md), the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.suite.ui.commons.statusindicator.StatusIndicator) and the [sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.suite.ui.commons.StatusIndicator).

**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model**

The new version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model introduces an adapter that allows you to use an OData V2 service together with the OData V4 model in read scenarios. The adapter offers the following features:

-   Metadata is converted, including some V2 annotations.

-   Data in the response is converted.

-   Literals in the request URI are converted, except for `Edm.DateTime`, `Edm.DateTimeOffset`, `Edm.Time`, and `Edm.Binary`.

-   `$select`, `$expand`, and `$orderby` are handled. Cases that are not supported by OData V2, like `$orderby` in `$expand`, lead to an error.

-   All unsupported query options lead to an error.


> ### Caution:  
> **Incompatibility Due to a Bug Fix**
> 
> The following bug has been reported: If you call the [sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context\#getObject\(\)](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context/methods/getObject) or the [sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context\#requestObject\(\)](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context/methods/requestObject) methods without a parameter, the expected and documented behavior is that the same result is returned as if the parameter `sPath=""` had been specified. However, due to the bug, the return value wraps the expected output that can then only be accessed via `.value[0]`, for example `oContext.getObject().value[0]`.
> 
> **If you have used this workaround, your application will break starting with SAPUI5 version 1.44.7.**
> 
> **Solution**: If your application needs to run with both the fixed and unfixed versions of SAPUI5, specify the `sPath=""` parameter, for the `sPath` parameter. In both cases, you **must not** use the workaround with `.value[0]` any longer.

> ### Restriction:  
> Due to the limited feature scope of this version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, check that all required features are in place before developing applications. Check the detailed documentation of the features, as certain parts of a feature may be missing. While we aim to be compatible with existing controls, some controls might not work due to small incompatibilities compared to `sap.ui.model.odata.(v2.)ODataModel`, or due to missing features in the model \(such as tree binding\). This also applies to Smart Controls \(`sap.ui.comp` library\) and SAP Fiori elements that do not support the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, as well as controls such as `TreeTable` and `AnalyticalTable`, which are not supported together with the SAPUI5 OData V4 model. The interface for applications has been changed for easier and more efficient use of the model. For a summary of these changes, see [Changes Compared to OData V2 Model](../04_Essentials/changes-compared-to-odata-v2-model-abd4d7c.md).

For more information, see [OData V4 Model](../04_Essentials/odata-v4-model-5de13cf.md), the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4), and the [sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel) in the Demo Kit.

**Support Assistant: OPA Test Sample Added**

<td valign="top">

**Support Assistant: OPA Test Sample Added**

With the roll-out of Support Assistant in version 1.48, we introduced the possibility to use the tool in OPA tests to check if there are issues in the different states of an application. This is possible by enabling the available OPA extension.

As of this version, there is now a sample of the OPA integration in the Demo Kit. It demonstrates how you can extend existing OPA tests by making calls to the assertions in the Support Assistant extension. These assertions may have different severity, execution scope and subset of rules which are taken into consideration. The sample also shows how to execute rule checks and how to get reports.

As of this version, there is now a sample of the OPA integration in the Demo Kit. For more information, see [Integrating the Rules in OPA Tests](../04_Essentials/integrating-the-rules-in-opa-tests-cfabbd4.md) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/sample/sap.ui.core.sample.OpaWithSupportAssistant/preview).

If set to `false`, the label text only uses one line and any exceeding text is truncated and replaced with an ellipsis. When you use the `Label` within a `sap.m.Form` the label text is automatically displayed as wrapped.

    ![](images/WhatsNew_150_LabelWrapping_a18049e.png)

-   `displayOnly`: Determines whether the label is in `displayOnly` mode. Controls in this mode are non-interactive, non-focusable, cannot be edited, and do not form part of the tab chain. The `displayOnly` property is used in `Form` controls when they are in preview mode.

<td valign="top">

**Analysis Path Framework \(APF\)**

APF has the following new feature:

-   If you want to configure several SAP Fiori tiles for one APF-based app to access data from multiple back-end systems, you can use the `sap-system` parameter to ensure that SAP Gateway directs the OData service requests to the correct back-end system. This is useful, for example, if you have a system landscape with regional back-end systems.

    For more information, see [Working with Multiple Back-End Systems](../07_APF/working-with-multiple-back-end-systems-9072139.md).


APF has been enhanced with the following features:

-   The export function has been enhanced so that you can now download a configuration file and a text properties file directly without having to copy and paste the content to a new file.

    For more information, see [Export](../07_APF/export-7de4975.md).

-   If a smart filter bar has mandatory fields, you can now start your analysis only if these mandatory fields are filled. Otherwise the *Add Analysis Step* button is inactive.

    For more information, see [Smart Filter Bar](../07_APF/smart-filter-bar-594f111.md).

-   The demo app for the APF runtime in the Demo Kit is now also available in German. To open the demo app in German, add the parameter `sap-language=de` to the URL: [Demo App with URL parameter **?sap-language=de**](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/apf/newDemokit/runtime/index.html?sap-language=de).
