# Tables

SAP Fiori elements supports several table types.

The following table types are available:

-   Responsive tables

    Responsiveness is optimized for mobile use. Line items can be viewed with no scrolling or with only vertical scrolling, regardless of the display width.

-   Grid table

    This is a desktop-centric table type that allows scrolling in both directions. It can handle a large number of items and columns.

-   Tree table

    This table type provides a comprehensive set of features to display hierarchical data. For more information, see [Tree Tables](tree-tables-7cf7a31.md).

-   Analytical table

    This table type contains data structured in rows and columns. It provides several powerful options for working with data, including advanced grouping and aggregations.

    In contrast to other tables, the analytical data binding used by the analytical table automatically displays an aggregated number in a cell.


The table representation that suits the service is chosen by default during the app creation. The responsive table is set as the default table type, but the analytical table is selected as the default table type for analytical services.

You can change the default table type to suit your needs.

For more information about the table types, see [Tables: Which One Should I Choose?](../10_More_About_Controls/tables-which-one-should-i-choose-148892f.md). For more information about defining the `UI.LineItem` annotation that describes the table, see [Defining Line Items](defining-line-items-f0e1e17.md).

The table control uses page mechanisms while loading data. It contains the following:

-   Layout management
-   A toolbar with actions rendered as text icons, for example, *Personalize*.

-   Application-specific actions rendered as text buttons, for example, *Copy*, *Approve*, and *Delete*.

-   An indication of draft status \(only for list report tables\)

-   A display of items locked by other users \(only for list report tables\)

## Default Selection Mode for Rows in Tables

By default, the table generated by the template uses the single-selection mode. End users select an item from the table to trigger a custom action, such as *Validate*, which then returns the results for the selected item.

Applications can change the single-selection mode to multi-selection mode. For more information, see [Configuring the Selection Mode for Tables](configuring-the-selection-mode-for-tables-116b5d8.md).

## Context Menu in Tables

Tables in list report, object page, and analytical list page applications support a context menu. The context menu is available as a default option and appears only when end users perform a right-click on a row or a set of selected rows. This menu displays all context-dependent actions, including both standard and custom actions that appear on the table toolbar. Additionally, an option to open the selected row or rows in a new browser tab or window is available within the menu. Inline actions are not included as part of context menu actions.

> ### Note:  
> When the table is configured to navigate to an object page in edit mode by setting `openInEditMode` to `true`, the *Open in New Tab* option is not shown in the context menu. For more information, see [Navigation to an Object Page in Edit Mode](navigation-to-an-object-page-in-edit-mode-8665847.md).

When implementing custom actions, you can use the `extensionAPI.getSelectedContexts` API to identify the rows associated with the context menu.

> ### Note:  
> You must use the `extensionAPI.getSelectedContexts` API only within synchronous code blocks. For more information, see [Defining Custom Actions](defining-custom-actions-c3de5c0.md).

## Showing or Hiding Columns Based on Importance and Available Screen Size in Responsive Tables

You can show or hide columns of the list report and object page tables depending on the screen width for situations like the following:

-   The browser window is small.
-   The application is running on a devise with a smaller screen.
-   You are using the flexible column layout.

The value of the `UI.Importance` annotation for the field determines which columns are hidden or moved when the screen size is reduced.

You can use the `UI.Importance` annotation to set the importance for table columns as follows:

-   `High`: Columns with a `High` importance setting are visible on all screen sizes. When the screen size is reduced, the columns shift to a pop-in area but remain visible on the screen.

-   `Low`: Columns with a `Low` importance setting are hidden on the screen when the screen size is reduced.

-   `None` \(default\) and `Medium`: Columns with `None` \(default\) and `Medium` importance settings are hidden automatically when the screen size is reduced.


For columns with `Low`, `None`, and `Medium` settings, the *Show More per Row* / *Show Less per Row* buttons appear in the table toolbar only if there's at least one hidden column. When the end user clicks the *Show More per Row* button, the hidden column information appears as a text in the pop-in area. To hide the pop-in area, click the *Show Less per Row* button.

> ### Note:  
> -   Columns that have no importance setting \(`None`\) but containing a semantic key are considered of `High` importance \(also when used in a `FieldGroup`\).
> 
> -   Columns with a `Low` importance setting are hidden first on smaller screens, followed by columns with the settings `None` \(default\) and `Medium`.

> ### Sample Code:  
> XML annotation
> 
> ```xml
> <Annotations Target="STTA_PROD_MAN.STTA_C_MP_ProductSalesPriceType">
>     <Annotation Term="UI.LineItem">
>         <Collection>
>             <Record Type="UI.DataField">
>                 <PropertyValue Property="Value" Path="PriceDay" />
>                 <Annotation Term="UI.Importance" EnumMember="UI.ImportanceType/High" />
>             </Record>
>             <Record Type="UI.DataField">
>                 <PropertyValue Property="Value" Path="TargetPrice" />
>                 <!-- This will be treated with default importance "None" which is the same as "Medium" -->
>             </Record>
>             <Record Type="UI.DataField">
>                 <PropertyValue Property="Value" Path="DiscountPriceTarget" />
>                 <Annotation Term="UI.Importance" EnumMember="UI.ImportanceType/Low" />
>             </Record>
>         </Collection>
>     </Annotation>
> </Annotations>
> 
> ```

> ### Note:  
> Starting from SAPUI5 1.87, SAP Fiori elements automatically calculates the default column width and provides an option to resize the column width in responsive tables. This is the default behavior. Having fewer columns in a table increases the free space available on the right side of the table.

## Hiding Table Columns Using the `UI.Hidden` Annotation

You can hide the table columns or specific fields within the table column in an analytical list page, list report, and object page. To hide the entire table column, set the `UI.Hidden` annotation value for any field as static `true`. To hide a specific field of a table column, set the `UI.Hidden` annotation value as a path-based value, and the fields for which `UI.Hidden` evaluates to `true` are hidden. For more information, see [Hiding Features Using the UI.Hidden Annotation](hiding-features-using-the-ui-hidden-annotation-ca00ee4.md).

> ### Note:  
> If the path-based value for `UI.Hidden` evaluates to `true` for all rows, then only the fields are hidden and not the entire column.

  
  
**DataField Records in Tables**

![](images/DataFieldRecords1_bd2e691.png "DataField Records in Tables")

> ### Sample Code:  
> XML Annotation
> 
> ```
> <Annotation Term="UI.LineItem">
>     <Collection>
>         <Record Type="UI.DataFieldForAnnotation">
>             <PropertyValue Property="Target" AnnotationPath="@UI.FieldGroup#multipleActionFields" />
>             <PropertyValue Property="Label" String="Sold-To Party" />
>             <Annotation Term="UI.Hidden" Path="Delivered" />
>         </Record>
>     </Collection>
> </Annotation>
> 
> ```

> ### Sample Code:  
> ABAP CDS Annotation
> 
> ```
> @UI.lineItem: [{
>     type: #AS_FIELDGROUP,
>     valueQualifier: 'multipleActionFields',
>     label: 'Sold-To Party',

> }
>

## Searching for Rows in a Table on an Object Page

In responsive, grid, and analytical tables, if the table is searchable \(that is, if an entity set is used for which `sap:searchable` is set as `true`\), a search field is displayed. You can search for particular rows in the table.



<a name="loioc0f6592a592e47f9bb6d09900de47412__section_uzk_54j_x4b"/>

## Defining the Column Width Using an Annotation

SAP Fiori elements automatically calculates the default width of columns containing texts based on the `MaxLength` property of the field defined in the metadata. The lower limit is set to 3 rem and the upper limit is set to 20 rem.

To customize the width of a column defined in a line item, use the UI annotation `com.sap.vocabularies.HTML5.v1.CssDefaults`. For more information, see [Setting the Default Column Width](setting-the-default-column-width-a765253.md).



<a name="loioc0f6592a592e47f9bb6d09900de47412__section_pth_3mb_dzb"/>

## Copying Multiple Rows and Range Selections

End users can copy multiple rows as well as ranges of rows and columns to the clipboard. The selected content \(rows or ranges\) can then be pasted to another application such as Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word, or to another SAP Fiori elements table. Note that the copying from a table functionality doesn't split the content for fields that contain an amount together with a unit of measure or currency, as well as for fields that contain a value and its description. After copying, end users need to adapt such content before pasting it to an SAP Fiori elements table.

> ### Note:  
> When using custom columns in SAP Fiori elements for OData V4, the cell content is the properties listed in the `property` array of the custom column definition. For more information, see [Extension Points for Tables](extension-points-for-tables-d525522.md).

To select a range with the mouse, click and hold while dragging to make a selection. As tables can have cells with editable fields, these fields automatically gain focus upon cell selection. To prevent this, press [CTRL\] on Microsoft Windows or [CMD\] on macOS before selecting a cell with the mouse. Keyboard shortcuts are also available as an alternative for cell selection.

## Optimizing Data Loading Using the `scrollThreshold` Property

As end users scroll within grid tables, tree tables, or analytical tables, the application dynamically loads additional records from the back-end system. By default, it loads 300 additional records while scrolling.

You can modify this value by configuring the `scrollThreshold` property.

For analytical tables and tree tables, `scrollThreshold` must be higher than `threshold` to take effect.

For more information about configuration in OData V2, see the [Configuring the `scrollThreshold` Property for Dynamic Data Loading](tables-c0f6592.md#loioc0f6592a592e47f9bb6d09900de47412__Configuring_the_scrollThreshold_Property_v2) subsection in the **Additional Features in SAP Fiori elements for OData V2** section of this topic.

For more information about configuration in OData V4, see the [Configuring the `scrollThreshold` Property for Dynamic Data Loading](tables-c0f6592.md#loioc0f6592a592e47f9bb6d09900de47412__Configuring_the_scrollThreshold_Property_v4) subsection in the **Additional Features in SAP Fiori elements for OData V4** section of this topic.

## Initial Data Loading Using the `threshold` Property

As responsive, grid, tree, and analytical tables load, the `threshold` property defines the number of initially loaded rows.

You can modify this value by configuring the `threshold` property.

You can configure the `threshold` property in the `manifest.json` file to specify the number of additional rows that can be preloaded from the back-end system. The specified value is added to the number of visible rows. For example, if `threshold` is set to 100 and there are 10 visible rows, the table loads a total of 110 records. This property applies to actions such as initial loading, sorting, and filtering.

> ### Note:  
> If `threshold` is set to 0, no additional records are preloaded, and `scrollThreshold` is used instead.

For more information about configuration in OData V2, see the [Configuring the `threshold` Property for Initial Data Loading](tables-c0f6592.md#loioc0f6592a592e47f9bb6d09900de47412__subsection_lvm_cjx_rfc) subsection in the **Additional Features in SAP Fiori elements for OData V2** section of this topic.

## Additional Features in SAP Fiori Elements for OData V2



### Smart Multi-Input Control

[Smart multi-input](../10_More_About_Controls/smart-multi-input-5644169.md) is automatically rendered as a column in responsive and grid tables if a 1:n relationship exists in the association for the given column.

To configure smart multi-input fields on an object page, see [Using the Multi-Input Field on the Object Page](using-the-multi-input-field-on-the-object-page-04ff5b1.md).



### Vertical Alignment of Responsive Tables

To define the vertical alignment for a responsive table, set the `tableColumnVerticalAlignment` manifest property under the settings of `sap.ui.generic.app` to the values `Top`, `Middle`, or `Bottom`.



### Showing or Hiding the *Copy to Clipboard* Button

By default, the *Copy to Clipboard* button is displayed in the table toolbar. However, you can also configure the visibility of the *Copy to Clipboard* button by defining the `copy` settings in the `manifest.json` file. If `copy` is set to `true`, the *Copy to Clipboard* button is shown in the table toolbar. If `copy` is set to `false`, the *Copy to Clipboard* button is hidden from the table toolbar.

### Hiding Columns Using the `UI.Hidden` Annotation on an Object Page

Table columns in the object page can be hidden using the `UI.Hidden` annotation either with a boolean value `true` or with a path referring to the property of the same entity or parent instance. If it points to a property of the parent entity, then the entire column is hidden. In the following example, `to_Product` is the navigation property pointing to the parent entity:

> ### Sample Code:  
> XML Annotation
> 
> ```
> <Annotation Term="UI.LineItem">
>     <Collection>
>         <Record Type="UI.DataField">
>             <PropertyValue Property="Value" Path="SoldToParty" />
>             <Annotation Term="UI.Hidden" Path="to_Product/Delivered" />
>         </Record>
>     </Collection>
> </Annotation>
> 
> ```

> ### Note:  
> -   You must not use the `UI.Hidden` annotation with a path for columns that support grouping, sorting, or filtering; this can lead to UX inconsistency as these operations are performed in the back end.
> 
> -   If the path for `UI.Hidden` defined on the table points to a field of its parent entity and it evaluates to `true`, then the entire column is hidden.



### Context Menu in Tables

In list report and object page tables, both standard and custom actions are available either as buttons or menu buttons in the table toolbar. A menu button can contain both types of actions. If it contains multiple actions, they appear as a sub-menu in the context menu. If the menu button contains only one action, that action is shown directly in the context menu.

By default, all standard actions are shown in the context menu. Custom actions appear only if `requiresSelection` is set to `true` and `excludeFromContextMenu` is either not defined or set to `false`, as shown in the following sample code:

> ### Sample Code:  
> `manifest.json`
> 
> ```
> "sap.ui.controllerExtensions": {
>     "sap.suite.ui.generic.template.ListReport.view.ListReport": {
>         "controllerName": "STTA_MP.ext.controller.ListReportExtension",
>         "sap.ui.generic.app": {
>             "STTA_C_MP_Product": {
>                 "EntitySet": "STTA_C_MP_Product",
>                 "Actions": {
>                     ...
>                     "CopyWithNewSupplier": {
>                         "id": "CopyWithNewSupplier",
>                         "text": "Copy with new Supplier",
>                         "press": "onCopyWithNewSupplier",
>                         "excludeFromContextMenu": false,
>                         "requiresSelection": true,
>                     }
>                     ...
>                 }
>             }
>         }
>     }
> }
> 
> ```

To exclude a custom action from the context menu, set `excludeFromContextMenu` to `true`.

> ### Note:  
> The *Open in New Tab or Window* option isn't available in the context menu, in the following cases, :
> 
> -   The list report or object page extension controller implements the `onListNavigationExtension` method.
> 
> -   The list report table is configured in direct edit mode. For more information about direct edit mode, see [Navigation to an Object Page in Edit Mode](navigation-to-an-object-page-in-edit-mode-8665847.md).

## Additional Features in SAP Fiori Elements for OData V4

> ### Note:  
> Analytical tables aren't supported on draft-enabled entities.



### Determining the Default Table Type

SAP Fiori elements for OData V4 determines the table type based on the configuration specified in the `manifest.json` file.

If the table type is not specified, the default table type is set based on the characteristics of the entity set with the following precedence:

-   The table type defaults to an analytical table if the table entity set supports analytical usage. This is indicated by the `@Aggregation.ApplySupported` annotation along with the following transformation functions:
    -   `filter`
    -   `identity`
    -   `orderby`
    -   `skip`
    -   `top`
    -   `groupby`
    -   `aggregate`
    -   `concat`

-   The table type defaults to a tree table if the table entity set supports hierarchical usage. This is indicated by both the `@Aggregation.RecursiveHierarchy` and the `@Hierarchy.RecursiveHierarchy` annotations with a common `RecursiveHierarchy` qualifier.
-   The table type defaults to a responsive table if neither analytical nor hierarchical usage is detected.



### Excluding Fields from Table Personalization

You can exclude specific fields from the table personalization dialog in the list report and object page by setting the `availability` property of the column to `hidden`. For more information, see [Enabling Table Personalization](enabling-table-personalization-3e2b4d2.md).



### Handling of Search Restrictions

> ### Note:  
> The analytical table works differently compared to grid tables and responsive tables. For more information about the configuration of different table types, see [Setting the Table Type](setting-the-table-type-7f844f1.md).

The search restriction for a table is first looked up in the parent entity \(using `NavigationRestrictions` at the parent entity, with the `NavigationProperty` pointing to the association of the table entity\).

-   Navigation Restrictions at Parent Entity

    > ### Sample Code:  
    > XML Annotation \(non-containment scenario\): `/SalesOrderManage/_Items`
    > 
    > ```xml
    > <Annotations Target="com.c_salesordermanage_sd.Container/SalesOrderManage">
    >     <Annotation Term="Capabilities.NavigationRestrictions">
    >         <Record>
    >             <PropertyValue Property="RestrictedProperties">
    >                 <Collection>
    >                     <Record>
    >                         <PropertyValue Property="NavigationProperty" NavigationPropertyPath="_Items" />
    >                         <PropertyValue Property="SearchRestrictions">
    >                             <Record>
    >                                 <PropertyValue Property="Searchable" Bool="false" />
    >                             </Record>
    >                         </PropertyValue>
    >                     </Record>
    >                 </Collection>
    >             </PropertyValue>
    >         </Record>
    >     </Annotation>
    > </Annotations>
    > 
    > ```

    > ### Sample Code:  
    > ABAP CDS Annotation
    > 
    > No ABAP CDS annotation sample is available. Use the local XML annotation.

    > ### Sample Code:  
    > CAP CDS Annotation \(non-containment scenario\)
    > 
    > ```
    > entity SalesOrderManage
    >     @(Capabilities: {
    >         NavigationRestrictions: {
    >             RestrictedProperties: [{
    >                 NavigationProperty: '_Items',
    >                 SearchRestrictions: {
    >                     Searchable: false
    >                 }
    >             }]
    >         }
    >     })
    > 
    > ```

    In a containment scenario \(for example, where the main entity set is from a parameterized entity\), you can maintain the annotations as shown in the following sample code:

    > ### Sample Code:  
    > XML Annotation \(containment scenario\): `/Customer/Set/_PartnerItems`
    > 
    > ```xml
    > <Annotations Target="sap.fe.test.MyService.EntityContainer/Customer">
    >     <Annotation Term="Capabilities.NavigationRestrictions">
    >         <Record>
    >             <PropertyValue Property="RestrictedProperties">
    >                 <Collection>
    >                     <Record>
    >                         <PropertyValue Property="NavigationProperty" NavigationPropertyPath="Set/_PartnerItems" />
    >                         <PropertyValue Property="SearchRestrictions">
    >                             <Record>
    >                                 <PropertyValue Property="Searchable" Bool="false" />
    >                             </Record>
    >                         </PropertyValue>
    >                     </Record>
    >                 </Collection>
    >             </PropertyValue>
    >         </Record>
    >     </Annotation>
    > </Annotations>
    > 
    > ```

    > ### Sample Code:  
    > ABAP CDS Annotation
    > 
    > No ABAP CDS annotation sample is available. Please use the local XML annotation.

    > ### Sample Code:  
    > CAP CDS Annotation \(containment scenario\)
    > 
    > ```
    > service MyService {
    >     @Capabilities.NavigationRestrictions.RestrictedProperties: [{
    >         $Type              : 'Capabilities.NavigationPropertyRestriction',
    >         NavigationProperty : 'Set/_PartnerItems',
    >         SearchRestrictions : { Searchable: false }
    >     }]
    > }
    > 
    > ```

-   Restrictions Directly at Child Entity

    If no search restriction is defined at the parent entity using `NavigationRestriction`, the search restriction defined directly on the table entity set \(child entity\) is considered.

    > ### Sample Code:  
    > XML Annotation \(non-containment scenario\): `/SalesOrderManage/_Items`
    > 
    > ```xml
    > <Annotations Target="com.c_salesordermanage_sd.Container/SalesOrderItem">
    >     <Annotation Term="SAP__capabilities.SearchRestrictions">
    >         <Record>
    >             <PropertyValue Property="Searchable" Bool="false" />
    >         </Record>
    >     </Annotation>
    > </Annotations>
    > 
    > ```

    > ### Sample Code:  
    > ABAP CDS Annotation
    > 
    > No ABAP CDS annotation sample is available. Use the local XML annotation.

    > ### Sample Code:  
    > CAP CDS Annotation \(non-containment scenario\)
    > 
    > ```
    > entity SalesOrderItem
    >     @(Capabilities: {
    >         SearchRestrictions: {
    >             Searchable: false
    >         }
    >     })
    > 
    > ```

    In a containment scenario \(for example, where the main entity set is from a parameterized entity\), you can maintain the annotations as shown in the following sample code:

    > ### Sample Code:  
    > XML Annotation \(containment scenario\): `/Customer/Set/_PartnerItems`
    > 
    > ```xml
    > <Annotations Target="SAP__self.Container/ItemPartner">
    >     <Annotation Term="SAP__capabilities.SearchRestrictions">
    >         <Record>
    >             <PropertyValue Property="Searchable" Bool="false" />
    >         </Record>
    >     </Annotation>
    > </Annotations>
    > 
    > ```

    > ### Sample Code:  
    > ABAP CDS Annotation
    > 
    > No ABAP CDS annotation sample is available. Use the local XML annotation.

    > ### Sample Code:  
    > CAP CDS Annotation \(containment scenario\)
    > 
    > ```
    > entity ItemPartner
    >     @(Capabilities: {
    >         SearchRestrictions: {
    >             Searchable: false
    >         }
    >     })
    > 
    > ```




### Freezing Table Columns

You can freeze table columns to keep them visible when scrolling the table horizontally. To do so, choose one of the following options:

-   You can use the *Column Settings* dialog to select a column to freeze. The selected column and all the columns to the left of it \(or right, if you use right-to-left mode\) are frozen.

-   You can use the `frozenColumnCount` parameter to choose a number of columns to freeze. To do this, add the `frozenColumnCount` parameter in the `manifest.json` file and specify how many columns to freeze. In the example below, the first three columns are frozen.

    > ### Sample Code:  
    > `manifest.json`
    > 
    > ```json
    > "_Item/@com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.LineItem": {
    >     "tableSettings": {
    >         "type": "GridTable",
    >         "frozenColumnCount": 3,
    >         …
    >     },
    >     …
    > }
    > 
    > ```


You can disable freezing columns using the *Column Settings* dialog with the `disableColumnFreeze` parameter at the table level of the `manifest.json` file.

> ### Sample Code:  
> `manifest.json`
> 
> ```json
> "_Item/@com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.LineItem": {
>      "tableSettings": {
>           "type": "GridTable",
>           "disableColumnFreeze": true,
>           …
>      },
>      ...
> }
> 
> ```

> ### Note:  
> Freezing table columns is not available in the responsive table.



### Calculating the Column Width

By default, the column width is calculated based on the type of the content. You can include the column header while calculating the column width by configuring the `widthIncludingColumnHeader` setting in the `manifest.json` file. This setting can be defined at the table level or at the column level. The `widthIncludingColumnHeader` setting defined at the column level has a higher priority than the `widthIncludingColumnHeader` setting defined at the table level.

> ### Sample Code:  
> `manifest.json`
> 
> ```json
> "controlConfiguration": {
>     "@com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.LineItem": {
>         "tableSettings": {
>             "widthIncludingColumnHeader": true
>         },
>         "columns": {
>             "DataField::commonProperty": {
>                 "widthIncludingColumnHeader": false
>             }
>         }
>     }
> }
> 
> ```



### Showing or Hiding the *Copy to Clipboard* Button

By default, the *Copy to Clipboard* button is displayed in the table toolbar if the selection mode, such as single selection or multi selection, is configured for the corresponding table. However, you can also configure the visibility of the *Copy to Clipboard* button by defining the `disableCopyToClipboard` settings in the `manifest.json` file as shown in the following sample code:

> ### Sample Code:  
> `manifest.json`
> 
> ```
> "sap.ui5": {
>     "routing": {
>         "targets": {
>             "SalesOrderManageList": {
>                 "options": {
>                     "settings": {
>                         "controlConfiguration": {
>                             "@com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.LineItem": {
>                                 "tableSettings": {
>                                     "disableCopyToClipboard": true
>                                 }
>                             }
>                         }
>                     }
>                 }
>             }
>         }
>     }
> }
> 
> ```

For more security-related information, see [Security Configuration](security-configuration-ba0484b.md).

The `Table` building block also supports the copy to clipboard option. For more information, see [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.fe.macros.Table%23overview).



### Configuring the `threshold` Property for Initial Data Loading

You can configure the `threshold` property in the `manifest.json` file as shown in the following sample code:

> ### Sample Code:  
> `manifest.json`
> 
> ```
> "targets": {
>                 "SalesOrderManageList": {
>                     "type": "Component",
>                     "id": "SalesOrderManageList",
>                     "name": "sap.fe.templates.ListReport",
>                     "options": {
>                         "settings": {
>                             "contextPath": "/SalesOrderManage",
>                             "controlConfiguration": {
>                                 "@com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.LineItem": {
>                                     "tableSettings": {
>                                         "type": "ResponsiveTable",
>                                         "threshold": 100
>                                     }
>                                 }
>                             }
>                         }
>                     }
>                 }
>             }
> ```
