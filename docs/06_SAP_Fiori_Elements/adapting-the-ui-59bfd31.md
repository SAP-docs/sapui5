# Adapting the UI

Both application developers and key users can extend and customize SAP Fiori applications.

For information about how application developers can enable an app for key user adaptation in SAP Fiori elements for OData V4, see [Enabling an App for Key User Adaptation](enabling-an-app-for-key-user-adaptation-ccd45ba.md).

## Adaptation by Application Developers

App developers can adapt the UI at design time.

For information about the features that application developers can adapt in SAP Fiori elements for OData V2, see [Adapting the UI: List Report and Object Page](adapting-the-ui-list-report-and-object-page-0d2f1a9.md).

In SAP Fiori elements for OData V4, app developers adapt the UI via manifest settings. You can search for features and navigate to the related documentation for further details using the [SAP Fiori Elements Feature Map](sap-fiori-elements-feature-map-62d3f7c.md).

## Key User Adaptation

Key users can adapt the application at runtime by changing the UI from the initial state of the app to a personalized view for end users. In the *User Actions Menu*, key users can then choose *Adapt UI* and change the user interface of SAP Fiori apps directly. For more information about what you have to consider when developing apps that support key user adaptation, see [SAPUI5 Flexibility: Enable Your App for UI Adaptation](../05_Developing_Apps/sapui5-flexibility-enable-your-app-for-ui-adaptation-f1430c0.md). For more information about key user adaptation, refer to [SAPUI5 Flexibility: Adapting UIs Made Easy](../04_Essentials/sapui5-flexibility-adapting-uis-made-easy-a8e55aa.md).

> ### Note:  
> In SAP Fiori elements for OData V2, key user adaptation supports only the use cases that are described in the section Additional Features in SAP Fiori elements for OData V2.

## Additional Features in SAP Fiori Elements for OData V2



### Variant Management

Key users can create public variants and deliver to all users or to users with specific roles. This is supported for page variants in list pages and table variants in list report and object pages.

Key users can also perform the following:

-   Modify existing public variants

-   Rename variants

-   Manage views by adding or removing favorites and modifying the visibility

While switching to the key user adaptation mode from the normal mode, the app starts in a fresh state and the applied changes are not preserved in the internal app state. Also, when a user exits the key user adaptation mode, the app restores to the old state it was in before entering the key user adaptation mode.

You can extend and customize SAP Fiori applications using the SAPUI5 Visual Editor in SAP Web IDE.
