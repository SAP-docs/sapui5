# Personalization

You can use the `p13n` namespace for personalization settings.

Personalization allows the user to define, for example, personalization settings for table content, such as sorting and grouping columns.

To set up personalization settings for a control, `sap.m.p13n.Engine` is available. The `sap.ui.fl.variants.VariantManagement` control is used to persist these settings and also offers a UI to manage view settings. `sap.m.p13n.Popup` provides further options for a personalization dialog.

For more information, see the [P13nify Everything - Personalization for Any Control Tutorial](https://github.com/SAP-samples/ui5-p13n-tutorial).
