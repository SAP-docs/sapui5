**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model**

The new version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model introduces the following features:

-   You can now use the experimental feature of moving nodes of a recursive hierarchy using`sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#move` with any initial expansion state of the hierarchy. An expansion state can be provided via the `expandTo` property of either the `$$aggregation` binding parameter or the `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding#setAggregation` API.

    For more information, see the API Reference for [`v4.Context#move`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context%23methods/move), [`v4.ODataModel#bindList`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel%23methods/bindList), and [`v4.ODataListBinding#setAggregation`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding%23methods/setAggregation).

-   If you move a node with the experimental `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#move` API and the moved node has siblings, it is now shown by default at a position assigned by the back end. Alternatively, you now have the option of moving the node to a position before a specified sibling or to the last position among its siblings.

    For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context%23methods/move).

-   The tree state is now kept when sorting or filtering a recursive hierarchy.

-   We have introduced the new `$$clearSelectionOnFilter` list binding parameter. When a filter or search is changed, it allows you to automatically deselect records that were selected via the experimental `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#setSelected` API.

    For more information, see the API Reference for [`v4.ODataModel#bindList`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel%23methods/bindList) and [`v4.Context#setSelected`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context%23methods/setSelected).
