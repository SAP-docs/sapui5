# App Development

There are several ways to develop OpenUI5 or SAPUI5 applications. Select the one that meets the requirements of your projects and your expectations best.



## Leverage UI5 Tooling

[UI5 Tooling](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/) complements the framework as an open and modular toolchain. It comes with a [command line interface \(CLI\)](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/pages/CLI/) based on Node.js and npm.

For an application project which has not been enabled yet for UI5 Tooling, follow the concise [Getting Started](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/pages/GettingStarted/) documentation for initial project setup.

The [OpenUI5 sample application](https://github.com/SAP/openui5-sample-app#openui5-sample-app), available on GitHub, shows typical development steps in your application project. The full set of commands can be seen in the [CLI](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/pages/CLI/#commands) documentation.

[Consuming SAPUI5 libraries](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/pages/SAPUI5/) is made easy when leveraging the UI5 Tooling. It allows for automatically downloading all required framework dependencies of a project.



## Using a Content Delivery Network

If you don't want to download the files and don't want to include them in your deployment, you can use the online version of OpenUI5 or SAPUI5 .
