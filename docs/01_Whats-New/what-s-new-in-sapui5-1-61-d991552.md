**Enabling Applications to Comply with the Content Security Policy \(CSP\)**

The SAPUI5 framework now allows you to run applications in an environment in which CSP has been enabled. Inline scripts are not required anymore, but you must still allow `eval()` for SAPUI5 to run. For details about the supported policies, and for recommendations on writing CSP-compliant applications, see [Content Security Policy](../05_Developing_Apps/content-security-policy-fe1a6db.md).

> ### Note:  
> An application needs to be prepared to the used policy to run in a CSP-enabled environment.

<code><b><code>sap.m.SinglePlanningCalendar</code></b></code>

The `sap.m.SinglePlanningCalendar` is a new control designed to display the schedule of a single resource. It can display three types of time intervals - a single day, a work week, or a full week. You can add custom actions to facilitate the interaction with the control.

**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model**

The new version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model introduces the following features:

-   `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#refresh` is supported for the bound context and the return value context of `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataContextBinding`.

-   You can now use `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#requestSideEffects` to load side effects when implicit loading is switched off via the binding-specific parameter `$$patchWithoutSideEffects`. This method must only be called on the bound context of a context binding, or on the return value context of an operation binding. With SAPUI5 1.61, there is only basic support for :n navigations, that is, the complete context is refreshed.

-   For the calculation of the path for reading data, relative bindings use the path of the context instead of the canonical path. The creation of a new entity uses the deep path as well. Use the `$$canonicalPath` binding-specific parameter to switch to the old behavior.


Note that we have introduced this change to support message processing.

> ### Restriction:  
> Due to the limited feature scope of this version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, check that all required features are in place before developing applications. Check the detailed documentation of the features, as certain parts of a feature may be missing. While we aim to be compatible with existing controls, some controls might not work due to small incompatibilities compared to `sap.ui.model.odata.(v2.)ODataModel`, or due to missing features in the model \(such as tree binding\). This also applies to smart controls \(`sap.ui.comp` library\) and SAP Fiori elements that do not support the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, as well as controls such as `TreeTable` and `AnalyticalTable`, which are not supported together with the SAPUI5 OData V4 model. The interface for applications has been changed for easier and more efficient use of the model. For a summary of these changes, see [Changes Compared to OData V2 Model](../04_Essentials/changes-compared-to-odata-v2-model-abd4d7c.md).

An autocompleted value can be accepted by pressing [Enter\].

**List Report and Object Page**

The list report has these new features:

-   By default, the analytical, grid, and tree tables in list reports use up all of the table container's space on the page. If you don't want the tables to use the entire space, you can set the `fitContent` property to `false`.


The object page has these new features:

-   Based on the default sort order, each new row is placed at the top of the table. You can disable this default sort order in the manifest.json and enter your own sorting logic. For more information, see [Enabling Inline Creation Mode or Empty Row Mode for Table Entries](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/enabling-inline-creation-mode-or-empty-row-mode-for-table-entries-cfb04f0.md).

-   Users can now toggle between the active and draft versions of the records in draft-enabled applications by using *Display Active Version* / *Continue Editing*.

**Overview Page**

The overview page has these new features or enhancements:

-   The Others sector of the donut chart in the analytical card type lets you pass filter conditions other than the dimensions shown on the donut chart. For example, in a donut chart with sectors A, B, C, and Others, navigation from Others sector leads to a filter condition excluding A, B, and C. For more information, see [Chart Cards Used in Overview Pages](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/chart-cards-used-in-overview-pages-68e62ad.md)

-   You can assign specific colours to the sectors within the donut chart. Each color can be associated with a particular dimension value. For more information, see [Chart Cards Used in Overview Pages](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/chart-cards-used-in-overview-pages-68e62ad.md)

-   You can expand or collapse the smart filter bar by using the new `bHeaderExpanded` descriptor configuration property. For more information, see [Descriptor Configuration for the Overview Page](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/descriptor-configuration-for-the-overview-page-f194b41.md)

-   Adapting to the modular core
-   Loading all resources asynchronously
-   Replacing deprecated APIs
-   Updating automated testing recommendations
-   Removing inline scripts in HTML pages

Some of these concepts use new APIs that have been available since SAPUI5 release 1.60.
