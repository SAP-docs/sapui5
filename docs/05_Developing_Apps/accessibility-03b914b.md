# Accessibility

In this guide we cover the most important accessibility aspects for application development, based on SAPUI5.

As an application developer, you need to be aware of accessibility in every step of the process. SAPUI5 controls have built-in accessibility features, but you need to take care when building and combining them into an application. First check the information in [Accessibility](../04_Essentials/accessibility-322f55d.md) in the Essentials section, if you havenâ€™t already.

The following chapters showcase different aspects and offer tips how to test your app.
