# Prerequisites for Using SAP Fiori Elements

To create an app using SAP Fiori elements, some prerequisites apply.

> ### Note:  
> SAP Fiori elements only supports a single service as the service behind the data for all its controls.
> 
> KPI tags used in the analytical list page and the `ValueHelp` annotation in SAP Fiori elements for OData V4 are exceptions to this rule.
> 
> Note the following for SAP Fiori elements for OData V4:
> 
> -   The service must support the following OData query options:
> 
>     -   `$count`
> 
>     -   `$skip`
> 
>     -   `$top`
> 
> 
> -   This requirement also applies to a value help service that is used via the `ValueListReference` annotation.

## Tool Support

We recommend that you use [SAP Fiori tools](https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/SAP_FIORI_tools/Latest/en-US), which is a set of extensions for SAP Business Application Studio and Visual Studio Code, to build your apps.

In SAP Fiori elements for OData V2, you can also use SAP Web IDE to build UI applications when using SAP Fiori elements.

> ### Caution:  
> SAP Web IDE is no longer available via SAP Business Technology Platform trial accounts. Any references to SAP Web IDE in this documentation are only relevant for you if you have access to SAP Web IDE through a productive SAP BTP account. Please consider SAP Business Application Studio as an alternative. See [App Development Using SAP Business Application Studio](../05_Developing_Apps/app-development-using-sap-business-application-studio-6bbad66.md).

For more information about SAP Web IDE, see the documentation for SAP Web IDE on the SAP Help Portal at [https://help.sap.com/viewer/p/SAP\_Web\_IDE](https://help.sap.com/viewer/p/SAP_Web_IDE).

> ### Note:  
> In SAP Fiori elements for OData V4, an edit scenario works in combination with a draft-enabled service.
