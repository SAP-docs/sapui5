## Developing Custom Controls in TypeScript

Check the [documentation](https://github.com/SAP-samples/ui5-typescript-helloworld/blob/custom-controls/README.md) and the sample code in the [custom-controls branch of the Hello World application](https://github.com/SAP-samples/ui5-typescript-helloworld/tree/custom-controls), which explains how you can implement custom controls in TypeScript within SAPUI5 applications. It makes use of a [tool for generating TypeScript interfaces for the control API](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-typescript/tree/main/packages/ts-interface-generator), which has been [released via npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ui5/ts-interface-generator) in beta state. There is also a sample project that demonstrates how fully-fledged [control libraries can be developed in TypeScript](https://github.com/SAP-samples/ui5-typescript-control-library).
