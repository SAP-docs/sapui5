**OData service `/UI5/ABAP_REPOSITORY_SRV`**

The OData service `/UI5/ABAP_REPOSITORY_SRV` is now available for loading SAPUI5 apps, components, or libraries into an SAPUI5 ABAP repository located on an SAP NetWeaver Application Server ABAP system for deployment and delivery. The service uploads the underlying files that are collected in a zip file. This can be of interest for SAPUI5 development teams that operate a continuous integration build with a build server, for example Jenkins, and manage their development in a version control system, for example, Git.

For more information, see [Using an OData Service to Load Data to the SAPUI5 ABAP Repository](../05_Developing_Apps/using-an-odata-service-to-load-data-to-the-sapui5-abap-repository-a883327.md).

**`sap.suite.ui.commons.MicroProcessFlow`**

Enables you to embed process flow indicators into other controls, such as headers, lists, and tables. This control acts as a generic container with process flow nodes laid out linearly along the horizontal axis. By default, the process flow nodes appear as circular icons that use semantic colors and provide click events. The default nodes can be replaced by other SAPUI5 controls, such as micro charts, status indicators, buttons, and labels.

For more information, see [Micro Process Flow](../10_More_About_Controls/micro-process-flow-28977b2.md), the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.suite.ui.commons.MicroProcessFlow) and the [Samples](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.suite.ui.commons.MicroProcessFlow).

<td valign="top">

**`sap.tnt.InfoLabel`**

Small non-interactive control whose purpose is to attract attention to a certain piece of information such as a state, quantity, condition. The control is vertically aligned with the SAPUI5 `Input` and `Button` control families.

`InfoLabel` has a `renderMode` property with the values `loose` and `narrow` that specify the side paddings. By default, the padding is loose, but for numeric text values, use narrow paddings.

![](images/Loose_padding_d1abdba.png)

![](images/Narrow_padding_3c06475.png)

The background and text color combinations are predefined. You can choose from 9 color schemes where the text content and choice of color depend on your preferences. The `colorScheme` property also accepts a digit as a value.

![](images/Color_schemes_8cea644.png)

The size of the `InfoLabel` control adjusts to fit other controls, such as non-editable forms or tables, when the `displayOnly` property is set to `true`.

Each attribute value can be changed, cleared, or kept as it is. The control provides value helpers, formatting, and validation, based on the data types of individual object attributes. For more information, see [Smart Multi Edit](../10_More_About_Controls/smart-multi-edit-0907251.md), the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.comp.smartmultiedit.Field) and the [Samples](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.comp.smartmultiedit.Container).

**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model**

The new version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model has the following features:

-   Enhancements to the adapter to use the V4 model with an OData V2 service:

    -   Handling of complex filters with `and`, `or`, `not`, brackets, and frequently used functions including `contains`.

    -   Support for bound operations by evaluating the V2 annotation `sap:action-for`.

    -   Additional annotation conversions and warnings \(in the console\) for V2 annotations that are not converted.


-   Suspend and resume absolute context and list bindings. A suspended binding will not send requests to the backend.

-   Possibility to refresh a single row in an absolute list binding.

-   Support of bound functions.

-   Newly created entities in an absolute list binding are refreshed/reread automatically after the successful post to the server.

-   It is now possible to request the `x-csrf` token and the root metadata document earlier. This is controlled by model parameter [`earlyRequests`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel/constructor).

    > ### Note:  
    > The default value of `earlyRequests` is **false** and this default may change in the future.

-   Action advertisements can be accessed in bindings by specifying `#<namespace>.<action>` 

    > ### Note:  
    > The previous method for metadata access is still available, but we recommend using a double hash \(\#\#\) syntax instead.


> ### Restriction:  
> Due to the limited feature scope of this version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, check that all required features are in place before developing applications. Check the detailed documentation of the features, as certain parts of a feature may be missing. While we aim to be compatible with existing controls, some controls might not work due to small incompatibilities compared to `sap.ui.model.odata.(v2.)ODataModel`, or due to missing features in the model \(such as tree binding\). This also applies to smart controls \(`sap.ui.comp` library\) and SAP Fiori elements that do not support the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, as well as controls such as `TreeTable` and `AnalyticalTable`, which are not supported together with the SAPUI5 OData V4 model. The interface for applications has been changed for easier and more efficient use of the model. For a summary of these changes, see [Changes Compared to OData V2 Model](../04_Essentials/changes-compared-to-odata-v2-model-abd4d7c.md).

For more information, see [OData V4 Model](../04_Essentials/odata-v4-model-5de13cf.md), the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4), and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel) in the Demo Kit.

**Support Assistant Performance and Usability Improvements** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

**Support Assistant Performance and Usability Improvements**

There are several improvements in the Support Assistant tool:

-   Better initial loading performance - now each library should have a `.supportrc` file in its root folder. The purpose of this file is to serve as a metadata container to be used by the Support Assistant ruleset loader module.

    For more information, see [Create a Ruleset for a Library](../04_Essentials/create-a-ruleset-for-a-library-b5a5135.md).

-   Improved perceived UI performance during initial tool loading – achieved by early and dynamic rendering of the most important UI elements and introducing a progress bar in the main screen of the Support Assistant.

-   Improved usability:

    -   The selection of rules to run an analysis has been improved. Now, selecting a library selects all the rules it contains.

    -   The *Issues* and *Rules* buttons are now highlighted to show the user which view is active at the moment.

    -   The issue details in the *Issues* view have been moved from the top to the bottom of the window for better usability.

-   A new `areaShrinkRatio` property is now available for the `sap.f.DynamicPageTitle` class. The property assigns shrinking ratios to the three areas in the `sap.f.DynamicPageTitle` \(Heading, Content, and Actions\). The greater value a section has the faster it shrinks when the screen size is reduced. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.f.DynamicPageTitle/controlProperties).

-   A new `stateChange` event is introduced for the `sap.f.DynamicPageTitle` class. The event is fired when the state of the title \(expanded or collapsed\) is toggled by user interaction \(by clicking/tapping on the title, by using the expand/collapse button, or by scrolling down the `sap.f.DynamicPage` content\). For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.f.DynamicPageTitle/events/stateChange).

**`sap.m.PlanningCalendar`**

-   A new `getSelectedAppointments` method is implemented which holds the IDs of the selected appointments. If no appointments are selected, an empty array is returned. This is an addition to the `appointmentSelect` event and its `appointment` parameter where you can listen for the value of the `selected` property. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.PlanningCalendar/methods/getSelectedAppointments) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/sample/sap.m.sample.PlanningCalendar/preview).

-   The control now provides the possibility for the user to drag and drop appointments in one `PlanningCalendarRow`. You can enable this behavior with the `enableAppointmentDragAndDrop` Boolean property. When an appointment is dropped over a drop target area, an `appointmentDrop` event is fired. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.PlanningCalendarRow) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/sample/sap.m.sample.PlanningCalendarDnD/preview).

-   For large screens, the date navigation arrows are now displayed closer to the date picker button to improve the experience of date navigation in the `sap.m.PlanningCalendar`.

-   With the use of the new `stickyHeader` property, you can now enable the header area to remain visible \(fixed on top\) when the rest of the content is scrolled out of view. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.PlanningCalendar) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/sample/sap.m.sample.PlanningCalendarWithStickyHeader/preview).

    > ### Restriction:  
    > There is limited browser support, hence the `stickyHeader` API is in experimental state. This API should not be used in a production environment.

-   Until now, the appointments in `sap.m.PlanningCalendar` were sorted vertically according to their duration with the longer ones being on top. With the introduction of the new API method `setCustomAppointmentsSorterCallback`, you can now sort the appointments in a custom way. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.PlanningCalendar) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/sample/sap.m.sample.PlanningCalendarOneLine/preview).

-   You can now add a description and align the text with the use of the new properties: `description`, `fieldWidth`, and `textAlign`. With the `description` property, you can display text after the input field. The `fieldWidth` property specifies how much of the available space is taken from the field and how much from the description \(equal by default\). The `textAlign` property enables you to choose how the numbers in the input field are aligned. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.StepInput/controlProperties).

-   The control now increases the speed in which the value changes when the user presses and holds the increase or decrease buttons.

-   With the new `stepMode` property, you can now decide which calculation method to use for the `value` when the user chooses the increase/decrease buttons. The `AdditionAndSubtraction` type simply adds/subtracts the current `step` to/from the `value`, while the `Multiple` type increases/decreases the `value` to the closest number that is divisible by the `step`. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.StepInput) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/sample/sap.m.sample.StepInput/preview).

-   The `RichTextEditor` now supports editing inserted links and images. If the `showGroupLink` or `showGroupInsert` are visible in the custom header, they will display three buttons - one for creating/editing a link, one for unlinking and one for creating/editing an image. Clicking on *Insert/Edit Link* without a selected item will create a new link or image. Clicking on the buttons while an object \(image or text\) is selected in the editor allows you to edit the properties of the selected object. If text is selected, it will be automatically entered as link text.

-   The `RichTextEditor` now provides an option for customizing the position of the button groups in the custom toolbar. This can be done by supplying a value for the new `customToolbarPriority` property of the button group. The property accepts positive numeric values. The groups in the toolbar are placed in ascending order respective to their `customToolbarPriority` values.

-   The color selection mechanism of the `RichTextEditor` is enhanced by using the newly introduced `sap.m.ColorPalette` control. It provides a default set of colors, an option for adding custom colors by selecting *More Colors…*, and the possibility to revert the color changes back to default by selecting *Default Color*. Once selected, the color can be easily applied to other elements.

-   We have a new tutorial: [OData V4 Tutorial](../03_Get-Started/odata-v4-tutorial-bcdbde6.md).

-   We have reworked the [Data Binding](../04_Essentials/data-binding-68b9644.md) section under *Essentials*.

-   We received feedback that many examples throughout the documentation were outdated and still used the old OData model, the deprecated `sap.ui.commons` library, or used the deprecated `jQuery.sap.require` syntax. We are currently working on updating all the occurrences, and you may already notice that we have made a big step forward in this version. Nevertheless, there will still be topics we could not yet update - please be patient and allow us some more time to finish this task.
