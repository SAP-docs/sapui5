# Make Your App CSP Compliant

CSP stands for Content Security Policy and is a security standard to prevent cross-site scripting or other code injection attacks.

It's strongly recommended that you make your SAPUI5 applications CSP compliant - after all, you want your apps to be secure. The main thing you have to do is to remove all scripts that directly execute code from your HTML pages.

## Define Initial Components in a Declarative Way

Don't use directly executable code in your HTML files, because this makes them vulnerable. Instead, enable the `ComponentSupport` module in the bootstrapping script. Then, declare your desired component in the body via a `div` tag. This will instantiate the component when the `onInit` is executed.

```html
...
<script id="sap-ui-bootstrap"
	src="resources/sap-ui-core.js"
	data-sap-ui-async="true"
	data-sap-ui-on-init="module:sap/ui/core/ComponentSupport">
</script>
<body class="sapUiBody" id="content">
	<div data-sap-ui-component data-name="sap.ui.demo.walkthrough" data-id="container" data-settings='{"id" : "walkthrough"}'></div>
</body>
```

## Separate Scripts From HTML Files in Your Test Folder

Because the HTML files in your test folder do not directly open your application, you can't use the new `ComponentSupport` feature here. To make them CSP compliant, you need to put the executable script code in a separate file on the same level as the HTML file. You can then refer to this file in your HTML file inside a `script` tag in the head:

New script file:

```js
window.suite = function() {
	"use strict";

	var oSuite = new parent.jsUnitTestSuite(),
		sContextPath = location.pathname.substring(0, location.pathname.lastIndexOf("/") + 1);

	oSuite.addTestPage(sContextPath + "unit/unitTests.qunit.html");
	oSuite.addTestPage(sContextPath + "integration/opaTests.qunit.html");

	return oSuite;
};

```

HTML file:

```html
<head>
	...
	<script src="testsuite.qunit.js" data-sap-ui-testsuite></script>
</head>

</html>

```
