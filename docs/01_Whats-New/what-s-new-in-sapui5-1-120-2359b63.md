**Deprecation of *Belize* Themes**

We have deprecated the *Belize* \(theme IDs: `sap_belize`, `sap_belize_plus`, `sap_belize_hcb`, `sap_belize_hcw`\) theme family as of SAPUI5 version 1.120.2.

We recommend that you switch to the *Horizon* theme family \(theme IDs: `sap_horizon`, `sap_horizon_dark`, `sap_horizon_hcb`, `sap_horizon_hcw`\).

**`sap.ui.table*`**

-   The `sorted` property of `sap.ui.table.Column` has been deprecated. Instead, the `sortOrder` property has been enhanced to also support `None` \(using `sap.ui.core.SortOrder`\), which is now the default. To ensure backward compatibility, `sortOrder` is automatically changed from `None` to `Ascending` if the `sorted` property is set to `true`. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.table.Column%23controlProperties) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.table.Table/sample/sap.ui.table.sample.Sorting).

-   We have improved the cell selection in these tables for `CellSelector` and the behavior when selecting cells and ranges.
    -   You can now use `sap.m.plugins.CellSelector` even with an inactive `DragDropConfig`. To control if the plugin is active, we have added the `enabled` property.

    -   When using the [Shift\] and [Up Arrow\], [Down Arrow\] keys for cell selection, the cell selection now takes precedence over the range selection. Pressing [Esc\] will remove the current cell selection. For more information, see the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.table.Table/sample/sap.ui.table.sample.SelectCopyPaste).

It builds on the `sap.m.upload.UploadSet` control. Using this control, you can also enable personalization settings with variant management.

You can preview your files using the `sap.m.upload.FilePreviewDialog` control. The `FilePreviewDialog` control works only along with the experimental `UploadSetwithTable` control.

**Apply Best Practices to Become Future-Ready \(as of 1.120.2\)**

The SAPUI5 framework has been evolving constantly, for instance to account for features in browser development \(such as modern ECMAScript support\) or their end of maintenance \(such as the end of IE11 support\). Substantial modularization efforts were a crucial step on this journey, which continues towards a future major version upgrade. In recent releases, but particularly with SAPUI5 1.120, a significant number of improvements have been introduced, for example the replacement of legacy APIs of the `Core` and `Configuration` modules.

To make sure that your code bases, that is, your SAPUI5 applications and libraries, do not become legacy but are ready for the future, please continue applying best practices. To support your efforts, we are updating the documentation in many places, with SAPUI5 1.120 but also beyond. [Best Practices for Developers](../03_Get-Started/best-practices-for-developers-28fcd55.md) aims to be a good starting point for you, collecting fundamental information and offering practical guidance. Thanks for your support!

To reflect these deprecations and the entities replacing them, the API Reference has been updated and documentation on the [Deprecated Configuration API](../04_Essentials/deprecated-configuration-api-2acafbf.md) has been added \(as of 1.120.2\). For an updated list of configuration options, see [Configuration of the SAPUI5 Runtime](../04_Essentials/configuration-of-the-sapui5-runtime-91f08de.md) and [Configuration Options and URL Parameters](../04_Essentials/configuration-options-and-url-parameters-91f2d03.md).

    For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context%23methods/isAncestorOf).

-   For recursive hierarchies, we provide the following **experimental APIs and features**. Note that they must not be used in productive applications yet:

    -   `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#getParent` and `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#requestParent` to retrieve the parent of a node

        For more information, see the API Reference for [`Context#getParent`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context%23methods/getParent) and [`Context#requestParent`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context%23methods/requestParent).

    -   Creating new root nodes

        For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding%23methods/create).

    -   Moving nodes to become root nodes \(as of 1.120.2\)

    -   Deleting nodes, even if an initial expansion has been set using the `expandTo` parameter of `$$aggregation` / `v4.ODataListBinding#setAggregation`

        For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context%23methods/delete).

    -   Creating nodes, even if an initial expansion has been set using the `expandTo` parameter of `$$aggregation` / `v4.ODataListBinding#setAggregation` \(as of 1.120.2\)

        For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4ODataListBinding%23methods/create).

        For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context%23methods/move).


-   The `withCredentials` model parameter is no longer experimental; you can now use it in productive applications.
