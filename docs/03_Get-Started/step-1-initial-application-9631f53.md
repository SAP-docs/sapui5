## Choose your development environment

In this tutorial, you don't have to worry about creating any test data. Everything is already included in the initial app and you can reference the data in every step. You can view and download the samples for all steps in the Demo Kit from [Ice Cream Machine](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.suite.ui.commons.tutorial.icecream).

> ### Note:  
> Note that we've not explained every single step of SAPUI5 application development, as we are focusing on selected controls. Topics such as data binding, navigation, or the MVC pattern are not covered. For more information, see [Essentials](../04_Essentials/essentials-ec699e0.md).
