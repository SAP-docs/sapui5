**Card Explorer**

-   An entire new *Integrate* section has been added to the Card Explorer with more information about card consumption in the host environment - in apps, dashboards, or on any HTML page. This section gives you more information on how to use integration cards in apps and about the integration card API.
-   The Card Explorer now preserves the page last visited and thus offers an improved usability and better navigation.

For more information, see [Card Explorer](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/index.html).

**Pre-Announcement: Deprecation of the SAPUI5 Tools for Eclipse**

Version 1.71 is the last SAPUI5 version for which we will update the [SAPUI5 Tools for Eclipse](https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/#sapui5).

> ### Caution:  
> After the release of SAPUI5 1.71, the SAPUI5 Tools for Eclipse will no longer be maintained.

We recommend that you use SAP Web IDE as the development environment for SAPUI5. For more information, see [App Development Using SAP Web IDE](../05_Developing_Apps/app-development-using-sap-web-ide-13ced94.md).

**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model**

The new version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model introduces the following features:

-   Custom HTTP headers can be set statically in the manifest or dynamically using `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel.changeHttpHeaders`.

-   Annotations for individual overloads of bound actions in the OData 4.01 format are understood as well.

-   `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context.requestSideEffects` can now also be called on a context belonging to a context binding that does not request data on its own. The call of `requestSideEffects` is propagated upwards in the binding hierarchy until a context binding or list binding that sends its own data requests is found. During the propagation, list bindings that do not send own data requests must not be passed.

-   Metadata parsing now uses a last-one-wins strategy for duplicated names consistently, also if operations are part of the duplicates.

-   With the model setting `autoExpandSelect:true`, property bindings that become active after their parent context or list binding has sent the first data request will be able to store their data so it can be reused by a later property binding with the same relative path and the same binding context.


> ### Restriction:  
> Due to the limited feature scope of this version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, check that all required features are in place before developing freestyle and SAP Fiori elements applications. Double-check the detailed documentation of the features, as certain parts of a feature may be missing. While we aim to be compatible with existing controls, some controls might not work due to small incompatibilities compared to `sap.ui.model.odata.(v2.)ODataModel`, or due to missing features in the model \(such as tree binding\). This also applies to smart controls \(`sap.ui.comp` library\) that do not support the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, as well as controls such as `TreeTable` and `AnalyticalTable`, which are not supported in combination with the SAPUI5 OData V4 model. The interface for applications has been changed for easier and more efficient use of the model. For a summary of these changes, see [Changes Compared to OData V2 Model](../04_Essentials/changes-compared-to-odata-v2-model-abd4d7c.md).

For more information, see [OData V4 Model](../04_Essentials/odata-v4-model-5de13cf.md), the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4), and the [Samples](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel).

This new feature will improve file recognition in automated test scenarios.

-   `sap.m.Input` - `Success` semantic state border is now 1 px for both the SAP Quartz Light and SAP Belize themes.

The list report has these new features:

-   The default text in the Delete dialog box has been enhanced to provide object information. For more information, see [Configuring the Delete Dialog Box](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/configuring-the-delete-dialog-box-15b7740.md).

-   You can use the SAPUI5 Visual Editor to improve the usability of the list report's table layout if a high number of columns is displayed by choosing different popin layout options. For more information, see [Adapting the UI: List Report and Object Page](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/adapting-the-ui-list-report-and-object-page-0d2f1a9.md).

The object page has this new feature:

In non-draft applications, the *Save and Edit* button can be enabled using the SAPUI5 Visual Editor. With this option, the object page can be kept forever in edit mode, with intermediate saving.
