Cell selection now works in combination with the `Row`/`RowOnly` behavior determined by the `sap.ui.table.SelectionBehavior` enumeration. If a cell selection already exists and the focus is on the cell, users can now extend the selection by pressing [Shift\] + [Up Arrow\]  and [Shift\] + [Down Arrow\]  or [Shift\] and clicking on a cell. To select a cell, users can now press [Spacebar\] if the `CellSelector` plugin is active. To select a row, users have to press [Shift\] + [Spacebar\]  or [Enter\]/ [Return\] instead of [Spacebar\]. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.plugins.CellSelector).

**`sap.gantt.skipTime.WeekPattern`** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

**`sap.gantt.skipTime.WeekPattern`**

We now provide support for hiding non-working hours from the Gantt timeline. Based on specific use cases, the feature allows applications to control the non-working hours on a granular level. With this new feature, applications can configure a weekly pattern specifying multiple time intervals per day that can be hidden. The time pattern supports hours, minutes, and seconds for each interval.

This feature is supported in stepwise zoom, proportional zoom, and the fullscreen strategies. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.gantt.skipTime.WeekPattern) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.gantt.simple.GanttChartWithTable/sample/sap.gantt.sample.GanttChart2HideNonWorkingHours).

In addition to the support for the weekly pattern, applications can extend the base discontinuity provider to define their own use cases for hiding specific parts of the Gantt timeline. For more information, see the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.gantt.simple.GanttChartWithTable/sample/sap.gantt.sample.GanttChart2HideNonWorkingDateRanges).

You can now add an icon before or after the link text. The icon is interactive, just like the link. You can also add two icons, one on each side, although we don't recommend this. To add an icon, set an icon URI to either of the newly introduced `icon` or `endIcon` properties. These properties only accept icons, not images.

**`sap.ui.integration.widgets.Card`**

-   We have introduced the `sap.f.cards.CardBadgeCustomData` element, which extends `sap.ui.core.CustomData`. It enables developers to add multiple badges on one card. Additionally, the new API allows them to add icons, state color, announcement text, and to control the visibility of the badge with the visibility mode. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.f.cards.CardBadgeCustomData) and the [Badge Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/badge)..

-   We have added a new `fallbackSrc` property available for images in Object cards. You can use it to set a fallback image source, in case the main `src` source fails to load. For more information, see the [Object Card](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/typesDeclarative/object) section and [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/object/objectCardWithFallbackImage) in the Card Explorer.

**`sap.f.FlexibleColumnLayout`**

-   We have introduced the new `layoutData` API to be used by applications to define the custom width of columns, depending on the user interactions/resizing with separators.

    The new `columnsDistributionChange` event is fired when the user manually resizes the `sap.f.FlexibleColumnLayout`. This event helps app developers to save user preferences and use them later. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.f.FlexibleColumnLayout).
