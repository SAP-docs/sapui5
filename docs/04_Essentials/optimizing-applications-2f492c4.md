		changed. As long as they are not changed, the resources can always be fetched from the
		browser's cache.")**

-   **[Application Cache Buster](application-cache-buster-ff7aced.md "The application cache buster (short AppCacheBuster) is similar to the cache buster but is used for application
		resources.")**
