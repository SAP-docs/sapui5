    > ### Note:  
    > To make sure that your last selection remains available for future use, choose *I agree to use local storage persistency* in the Support Assistant Settings menu.

-   An **ID field** has been added to the *Export a Rule Preset* dialog. The ID is a string of alphanumeric symbols added manually by the user when creating a rule preset. It is useful in case you want to collect data and generate reports on specific rule preset executions within your organization.

    For more information, see [Rules Management](../04_Essentials/rules-management-3fc864a.md).


**Rules View Personalization**

The Support Assistant now allows you to personalize the *Rules View* by:

-   Choosing which columns to be visible and which to remain hidden feature has been introduced. It allows you to import, export, and switch between multiple user-defined subsets of preselected rules. You can see all imported rule presets in a dropdown menu and easily switch between them. Your current selection of rules is saved in

-   Sorting the information within a column or filtering it by keyword. To access these options, click on a column header. A dropdown menu opens from which you can choose the desired action.

**`sap.suite.ui.commons.TAccount`**

A control that can be used to display individual line items from one or more accounting documents affecting several general ledger accounts. In T accounts, the line items are entered in two columns, debit and credit, and the account name is placed above those columns, resulting in a T-shaped structure. T accounts can be grouped based on their type or a common attribute, such as balance sheet T accounts and income statement T accounts. A T-account group is displayed as a collapsible panel that provides additional information, such as the total balance of all accounts in the group. On top of the T-account groups, you can add a toolbar that shows total balance across all accounts included in the control and provides additional actions and details.

For more information, see [T Account](../10_More_About_Controls/t-account-fe6792f.md), the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.suite.ui.commons.TAccount), and the [Samples](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.suite.ui.commons.TAccount).

**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model**

The new version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model introduces the following features:

-   Messages sent in the `sap-messages` header are evaluated by the model and transmitted to the message model.

-   Messages sent in the data response of success responses are processed by the OData V4 model and forwarded to the message model. The message property needs to have the documented structure and its existence needs to be communicated using the dedicated metadata annotation `com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.Messages`. For more information, see [OData V2 Messages](../04_Essentials/odata-v2-messages-81c735e.md).

-   Batch groups whose names start with `$auto.` are handled like the predefined group `$auto`.

-   Exclude filters `NB` \(not between\), `NotContains`, `NotEndsWith`, and `NotStartsWith` are supported.


> ### Restriction:  
> Due to the limited feature scope of this version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, check that all required features are in place before developing applications. Check the detailed documentation of the features, as certain parts of a feature may be missing. While we aim to be compatible with existing controls, some controls might not work due to small incompatibilities compared to `sap.ui.model.odata.(v2.)ODataModel`, or due to missing features in the model \(such as tree binding\). This also applies to smart controls \(`sap.ui.comp` library\) and SAP Fiori elements that do not support the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, as well as controls such as `TreeTable` and `AnalyticalTable`, which are not supported together with the SAPUI5 OData V4 model. The interface for applications has been changed for easier and more efficient use of the model. For a summary of these changes, see [Changes Compared to OData V2 Model](../04_Essentials/changes-compared-to-odata-v2-model-abd4d7c.md).

For more information, see [OData V4 Model](../04_Essentials/odata-v4-model-5de13cf.md), the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4), and the [Samples](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel).

-   You can now use the `sapUiContentPadding`, `sapUiNoContentPadding`, and `sapUiResponsiveContentPadding` CSS classes to adjust the content padding of the `DynamicPage` control.For more information, see [Using Container Content Padding CSS Classes](../04_Essentials/using-container-content-padding-css-classes-c71f6df.md) and the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.f.DynamicPage/aggregations). 

-   The `sap.f.DynamicPageHeader` and `sap.f.DynamicPageTitle` classes now introduce a new `backgroundDesign` property which has three background options - `Solid`, `Transparent`, or `Translucent`. For the new property to be supported correctly when using the dynamic header in `sap.uxap.ObjectPageLayout`, a new `backgroundDesignAnchorBar` property is added to `sap.uxap.ObjectPageLayout`, which is used to control the background color of the `sap.uxap.AnchorBar` through its own newly added `backgroundDesign` property.For more information, see the *API Reference* for [`sap.f.DynamicPageHeader`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.f.DynamicPageHeader), [`sap.f.DynamicPageTitle`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.f.DynamicPageTitle), [`sap.uxap.ObjectPageLayout`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.uxap.ObjectPageLayout), and [`sap.uxap.AnchorBar`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.uxap.AnchorBar).

-   The tooltips of the predefined colors have been formatted in order to be more easily recognizable by users. Now they start with a capital letter, and there are intervals between the words, for example "indianred" has been changed to "Indian Red". For more information, see the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/sample/sap.m.sample.ColorPalette/preview).

-   The keyboard navigation has been improved by implementing a more intuitive use of the [Up\], [Down\], [Home\], and [End\] keys. In terms of navigation, the color swatch items are treated as columns. For example, if the focus is on the first or on the last item, pressing [Up\] or [Down\] will move the focus respectively to the *Default Color* or *More Colors* button. [Home\] moves the focus to the first color in the row, to the first color in the container, or to the *Default Color* button. [End\] moves the focus to the last color in the row, to the last color in the container, or to the *More Colors* button.

The `sap.m.MessageItems` that are aggregated in these controls have a new property - `activeTitle`. If set to `true`, the item’s title will be rendered as a link. Then, an event handler function should be provided for the `activeTitlePress` event, which is an event fired by the control when an active item title is pressed. This allows application developers to link a message in the control to the originating UI element in the application and, for example, automatically scroll to it.

-   A newly introduced sample demonstrates the recommended usage of the deselection logic when the calendar is in single selection mode. The implementation of this logic allows the app to support deselection of dates so that the user can deselect a previously selected date. For more information, see the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/sample/sap.ui.unified.sample.CalendarDateDeselection/preview).

-   A new `weekNumberSelect` event is introduced which allows you to select a complete week by clicking on the week number.

**SAP Fiori Elements** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

**SAP Fiori Elements**

**General Features**

SAP Fiori elements have the following new enhanced features that apply to several floorplans:

The new extension method `modifyStartupExtension` is available. It can be used for the following purposes:

-   Modifying selection variants: You can modify the filter context while navigating from the SAP Fiori launchpad or from another application to the list report, the overview page, or the analytical list page.

-   Choosing a particular tab dynamically when starting a multitab list report application


For more information, see [Modifying Startup Parameters Using an Extension](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/modifying-startup-parameters-using-an-extension-4564eed.md).

**List Report and Object Page**

List report and object page have the following new and enhanced features:

**General Features**

You can add multiple IDs, descriptions, and action buttons to one column in a responsive table.

For more information, see [Adding Multiple Fields to One Column in Responsive Tables](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/adding-multiple-fields-to-one-column-in-responsive-tables-d318e42.md).

**List Report View**

The sticky toolbar is now enabled by default in list reports. It is visible even when users scroll through the content of a table.

**Object Page View**

-   For fields where users can enter more than one value, the `SmartMultiInput` control is rendered on the object page if specific conditions are met. For more information, see [Using the Multi-Input Field on the Object Page](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/using-the-multi-input-field-on-the-object-page-04ff5b1.md).

-   You can now add titles to tables on the object page. For more information, see [Adding Titles to Object Page Tables](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/adding-titles-to-object-page-tables-d9a4539.md).

-   The new `SmartForm` control is enabled per default on the object page. This improves the look and feel of the app as the content of a form is now distributed more evenly. For more information, see the [API Reference: `SmartForm`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.comp.smartform.SmartForm) and [Extension Points for Forms on the Object Page](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/extension-points-for-forms-on-the-object-page-4e49753.md).


**Analytical List Page**

Visual filters now support date-based single selection fields in Universal Time Coordinated \(UTC\) format. The date selection field appears on the visual filter for fields annotated as `sap:filter-restriction=”single-value"`. For more information, see [Visual Filters](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/visual-filters-1714720.md).

**Overview Page**

Overview page has the following new and enhanced features:

-   You can now disable navigation from the analytical list card header area by setting the descriptor property `"navigation": "noHeaderNav"`. For more information, see [Descriptor Configuration for the Overview Page](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/descriptor-configuration-for-the-overview-page-f194b41.md).

-   Analytical card now supports a new dual combination chart type that lets you clearly view individual data points for a particular dimension. The chart contains two axis values with a line chart representing the multiple measures. For more information, see [Chart Cards Used in Overview Pages](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/chart-cards-used-in-overview-pages-68e62ad.md).

-   A new user role is added \(key user\) to perform UI adaptation at runtime. For more information, see [Key User Capabilities](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/key-user-capabilities-4966938.md).

Until now the *API Reference* tree displayed by default all APIs including deprecated ones. Now we've added an *Include deprecated* checkbox above the tree that allows you to choose whether to see the full list. If it's selected, the deprecated items are displayed in the tree with the label *Deprecated* so you can easily identify them without opening each class.
