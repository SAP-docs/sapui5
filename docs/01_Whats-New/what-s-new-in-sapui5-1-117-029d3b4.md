**Deprecations**

We have deprecated the following entities for `sap.ui.table*`:

-   `sap.ui.table.ColumnMenu` and `sap.ui.table.AnalyticalColumnMenu`

-   `menu` aggregation of `Column`

-   `columnMenuOpen` event of `Column`
-   `columnVisibilityMenuSorter` property of `AnalyticalTable`

-   `showColumnVisibilityMenu` property of `Table`

-   `columnVisibility` event of `Table`

Instead of the deprecated `ColumnMenu`, you can use the `sap.m.table.columnmenu.Menu` control.

For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.table.columnmenu.Menu) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.table.Table/sample/sap.ui.table.sample.Menus).

Refreshing table data via binding might be required if it has been changed in the back end. For example, a user might have selected *Go* in the filter bar without actually changing any filter settings. To evaluate whether the binding needs to be refreshed, even if `bindingInfo` has not changed, the `TableDelegate` uses the new `updateBinding` parameter `mSettings.forceRefresh`.

Such changes are also not considered when users navigate from the integration cards to the application. For more information, see [Store/Restore the Application State](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/store-restore-the-application-state-46bf248.md).

**Modern ECMAScript Support in SAPUI5**

Since SAPUI5 1.116, the framework leverages features of modern ECMAScript up to and including [ECMAScript 2022 Language Specification](https://262.ecma-international.org/13.0/). There are certain restrictions you have to consider when using modern ECMAScript with your UI5 project.

For more information, see [ECMAScript Support](../02_Read-Me-First/ecmascript-support-0cb44d7.md). Please also make sure to [upgrade your tools for modern ECMAScript in UI5](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/05/24/upgrade-your-tools-for-modern-ecmascript-in-ui5/).

**Theme-Dependent Custom Icon Fonts**

You can now configure variants of a custom icon font for different UI5 themes; previously, a custom icon font was applied to all themes. With an enhanced version of the metadata JSON file associated with an icon font, you can provide theme-dependent path configuration. For instance, this allows you to easily differentiate between custom icons for modern themes, such as SAP Horizon, and custom icons for older themes.

-   **Experimental:** You can now create a nested single entity behind a single-valued navigation property in the transient entity.

To implement this behavior, for the following EDM types when annotated with `nullable=false` and `Common.v1.FieldControlType/Optional`, we pass a `parseEmptyValueToZero` formatter option:

-   Edm.Int64
-   Edm.Decimal
