# Test Automation

To make sure that the code is always tested thoroughly before it is included in a productive app, you should use a test runner that automates tests. The test runner can be included in your project setup so that it is called whenever code changes are submitted.

In the following section, we describe the setup with *Karma*, but you can of course choose a different solution.

*Karma* uses plugins to add support for various framworks. For SAPUI5, you can use the `karma-ui5` plugin that helps with testing SAPUI5 projects.

## Installing Karma for Automated Testing

Initial setup of the application testing environment with Karma.



<a name="loioa182676ed3714bd5b4f011eb29076f6c__prereq_opk_1my_bcb"/>

## Prerequisites

You have installed the *current* or *LTS* version of *Node.js* from [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)



<a name="loioa182676ed3714bd5b4f011eb29076f6c__steps_av1_rfy_bcb"/>

## Procedure

1.  Install the *Karma CLI* globally via *npm* so that you can run *Karma* by typing the `karma` command in the command-line interface \(CLI\).

    For more information, see the [Karma Installation Guide on GitHub](http://karma-runner.github.io/latest/intro/installation.html).

    Use the following command:

    ```
    npm install --global karma-cli
    ```

2.  Create a `package.json` file.

    -   If you already have an *npm* project, you can skip this step.

    -   If not, use the following command:

        ```
        npm init --yes
        ```


3.  Install *Karma* locally in your working directory.

    Use the following command:

    ```
    npm install --save-dev karma
    ```

4.  Install the *Karma UI5 plugin* locally in your working directory.

    Use the following command:

    ```
    npm install --save-dev karma-ui5
    ```

5.  Install the *Karma Chrome Launcher* locally in your working directory.

    Use the following command:

    ```
    npm install --save-dev karma-chrome-launcher
    ```

    In this example, we use Google Chrome as browser. You can find an overview of availabler browser launchers by searching for packages with the keywords `karma-launcher` on the *npm* home page.

6.  Create a `karma.conf.js` file in your working directory with the following content.

    -   If you are using UI5 Tooling in your project, you can use the following configuration:


    ```js
    
          module.exports = function(config) {
            config.set({
    
              frameworks: ["ui5"],
    
              browsers: ["Chrome"]
        
        });
      };
    ```

    -   If you are **not** using UI5 Tooling in your project, you can use the following configuration:


    ```
    
    module.exports = function(config) {
            config.set({
    
              frameworks: ["ui5"],
    
              ui5: {
                url: "https://<<server\>\>:<<port\>\>"
              },
    
              browsers: ["Chrome"]
    
            });
          };
    ```

    Adapt the URL \(<code><i class="varname">&lt;server\&gt;</i>:<i class="varname">&lt;port\&gt;</i></code> to the SAPUI5 resources according to your installation. You can also use SAPUI5 from a content delivery network, see [Variant for Bootstrapping from Content Delivery Network](variant-for-bootstrapping-from-content-delivery-network-2d3eb2f.md).

    > ### Note:  
    > The SAPUI5 plugin uses sensible defaults to detect your type of project and the relevant folders. If you have a project with a different structure, you need to add some more configuration options. For more information, see the [Karma UI5 documentation](https://github.com/SAP/karma-ui5#about) on GitHub.

7.  You can now run the tests with the following command:

    ```
    karma start
    ```

## Continuous Integration With Headless Chrome

For running tests in CI scenarios, such as Travis CI in GitHub, Headless Chrome needs to be used. Headless Chrome is a Chromium Browser without GUI \(in a headless environment\).

You can use Headless Chrome standalone, but also with Karma. To launch Karma with Headless Chrome, you need to add the following changes to the karma config.

1.  Add `karma-chrome-launcher` to the project dev dependencies.

    ```
    npm install -D karma-chrome-launcher
    ```

    > ### Note:  
    > This is only required, if Chrome is **not** used as browser, that means, it was not defined during karma initialization. In some cases, for example for running tests in a docker container, we recommend to add puppeteer as dependency which includes the latest Chrome version. For more details, see the karma-chrome-launcher repository on GitHub.

2.  Define the browser environment for running karma. For this, update the `config` object in `karma.conf.js` as follows:

    ```js
    module.exports = function(config) {
      config.set({
        [...]
        browsers: ['ChromeHeadless'],
        singleRun: true
        [...]
      })
    }
    ```

    > ### Note:  
    > Make sure to set the `singleRun` flag to `true`. Otherwise, the script ends up in watch mode, listening for file changes.


You can launch karma also with a specific config file. It might make sense, for example, to define a config file \(default: `karma.conf.js`\) for the local environment, and one config file, for example `karma-ci.conf.js` for the CI scenario. To launch karma with a different config file, add the file name as third parameter as follows:

```js
karma start karma-ci.conf.js
```

## Code Coverage

To measure the code coverage, you can use the [*Coverage* plugin](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-coverage) for *Karma*.

In case your application is started within a frame \(`iStartMyAppInAFrame`\) you need to enable iFrame coverage reporting. See the [Karma UI5 documentation](https://github.com/SAP/karma-ui5#configureiframecoverage) for details.

For more information about OPA5, see the [API Reference: `sap.ui.test.Opa5`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.test.Opa5).
