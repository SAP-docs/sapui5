**New Themes for SAP Fiori 3 User Experience**

The High Contrast White \(HCW\) and High Contrast Black \(HCB\) themes \(`sap_fiori_3_hcw`/`sap_fiori_3_hcb`\) are now delivered with all SAP Fiori-related libraries. They offer a better visual experience for people with visual impairments.

**Require Modules in XML Views and Fragments**

Modules can now be required in XML views and fragments and assigned to aliases which can be used as variables in properties, event handlers, and bindings. Such a declarative approach can help to avoid global variables and allows to reuse certain helper classes without a detour via Controller code.

The new `require` attribute with namespace URI `sap.ui.core` can be used to define the module aliases and paths. This attribute can be used at every element of an XML view or fragment. You can specify a list of required modules as Unified Resource Names, similar to `sap.ui.require` and assign aliases to them using a JSON-like syntax.

For details and examples, see [Require Modules in XML View and Fragment](../04_Essentials/require-modules-in-xml-view-and-fragment-b11d853.md).

**Rule Builder: Migrate projects from expression language 1.0 to expression language 2.0**

Migrate your project from expression language 1.0 \(Rule expression language\) to expression language 2.0 \(DMN SFEEL\) using Business Rules API.

For more information, see [Rule Builder Control](../03_Get-Started/rule-builder-control-67fcb30.md).

**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model**

The new version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model introduces the following features:

-   The original of a bound message is available in the message model as `technicalDetails.originalMessage`. This can be used to transport additional information.

-   When calling `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context.requestSideEffects`, you can now specify a group ID. You can use this to read side-effects that load slowly in a separate request. Note that you have to ensure in the application that no pending changes for the affected properties exist.

-   You can now use the Partner attribute of navigation properties to automatically shorten paths by removing Partner :n and :1 navigation properties that are adjacent in the path. This allows to access already available data in parent bindings.

-   The `caseSensitive` flag is now supported for `sap.ui.model.Filter`. Note that if case-insensitive filtering is requested, the OData function `tolower` is used for all operands.

-   To asynchronously access data in controller code through bindings, you can now use the `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataContextBinding.requestObject` and `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataPropertyBinding.requestValue` functions.


> ### Restriction:  
> Due to the limited feature scope of this version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, check that all required features are in place before developing freestyle and Fiori elements applications. Double check the detailed documentation of the features, as certain parts of a feature may be missing. While we aim to be compatible with existing controls, some controls might not work due to small incompatibilities compared to `sap.ui.model.odata.(v2.)ODataModel`, or due to missing features in the model \(such as tree binding\). This also applies to smart controls \(`sap.ui.comp` library\) that do not support the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, as well as controls such as `TreeTable` and `AnalyticalTable`, which are not supported together with the SAPUI5 OData V4 model. The interface for applications has been changed for easier and more efficient use of the model. For a summary of these changes, see [Changes Compared to OData V2 Model](../04_Essentials/changes-compared-to-odata-v2-model-abd4d7c.md).

For more information, see [OData V4 Model](../04_Essentials/odata-v4-model-5de13cf.md), the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4), and the [Samples](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel).
