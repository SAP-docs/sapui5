# Step 20: Data Types \(TypeScript\)

The list of invoices is already looking nice, but what is an invoice without a price assigned? Typically prices are stored in a technical format and with a '`.`' delimiter in the data model. For example, our invoice for pineapples has the calculated price `87.2` without a currency. We are going to use the SAPUI5 data types to format the price properly, with a locale-dependent decimal separator and two digits after the separator.

## webapp/controller/InvoiceList.controller.ts \(New\)

We want to display in our list view the price in Euro, and typically the currency is part of our data model in the back end. Here this is not the case, so we need to define it directly in the app. We therefore create a controller for the invoice list and define a view model for the currency code for Euro. It is a simple JSON model with just one key `currency` and the value `EUR`.

```js
import Controller from "sap/ui/core/mvc/Controller";
import JSONModel from "sap/ui/model/json/JSONModel";

/**
 * @namespace ui5.walkthrough.controller
 */
export default class App extends Controller {
    
    onInit(): void {
        const viewModel = new JSONModel({
            currency: "EUR"
        });
        this.getView()?.setModel(viewModel, "view");        
    } 
};
```

## webapp/view/InvoiceList.view.xml

We add a reference to the invoice list controller to the view to get access to the view model we defined in the controller.

We add a price and the currency to our invoices list in the view by adding the `number` attribute to the `ObjectListItem` control, then we apply the currency data type on the number by setting the `type` attribute of the binding syntax to `sap.ui.model.type.Currency`. The `Currency` type handles the formatting of the price for us based on the currency code. In our case, the price is displayed with 2 decimals.

Additionally, we set the formatting option `showMeasure` to `false`. This hides the currency code in the property `number`, because it is passed on to the `ObjectListItem` control as a separate property `numberUnit`.

```xml
<mvc:View
    controllerName="ui5.walkthrough.controller.InvoiceList"
    xmlns="sap.m"
    xmlns:mvc="sap.ui.core.mvc">
    <List
        headerText="{i18n>invoiceListTitle}"
        class="sapUiResponsiveMargin"
        width="auto"
        items="{invoice>/Invoices}">
        <items>
            <ObjectListItem
                title="{invoice>Quantity} x {invoice>ProductName}"
                number="{
                    parts: [
                        'invoice>ExtendedPrice',
                        'view>/currency'
                    ],
                    type: 'sap.ui.model.type.Currency',
                    formatOptions: {
                        showMeasure: false
                    }
                }"
                numberUnit="{view>/currency}"/>
        </items>
    </List>
</mvc:View>
```

As you can see above, we use a special binding syntax for the `number` property of the `ObjectListItem`. This binding syntax makes use of so-called "Calculated Fields", which allows the binding of multiple properties from different models to a single property of a control. The properties bound from different models are called “parts”. In the example above, the property of the control is `number` and the bound properties \(“parts”\) retrieved from two different models are `invoice>ExtendedPrice` and `view>/currency`.



## Conventions

Use data types instead of custom formatters whenever possible.
