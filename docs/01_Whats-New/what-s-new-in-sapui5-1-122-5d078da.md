**Support for Async Control Event Handlers**

You can now use the modern “`async`/`await`” JavaScript syntax for control event handlers. We have adjusted some tutorials and samples to benefit from this coding style.

Keep in mind that certain restrictions remain for asynchronous functions; in particular, they should not be used with the lifecycle hooks predefined by the SAPUI5 framework.

For more information, see [Async Functions and Event Handlers](../02_Read-Me-First/ecmascript-support-0cb44d7.md#loio0cb44d7a147640a0890cefa5fd7c7f8e__section_EHR).

**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model**

The new version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model introduces the following features:

-   The selection set via the experimental `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#setSelected` method is now also available via the experimental `@$ui5.context.isSelected` client-side annotation.

-   The `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#requestParent` and `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#getParent` methods that we introduced with SAPUI5 1.120 are no longer experimental; you can now use them in productive applications.

-   The `refresh` and `requestRefresh` methods of `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataContextBinding` and `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding` now also work on bindings for which the `$$ownRequest` binding parameter is set to `true`.

-   For columns with a text arrangement annotation, we no longer display *Description* as an option in the *Columns* tab of the table's personalization dialog. For more information, see [Enabling Table Personalization](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/enabling-table-personalization-3e2b4d2.md).

**Connectors for Bootstrapping SAPUI5 Flexibility**

You can use the new `BtpServiceConnector` to connect SAPUI5 flexibility services on SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment. In addition to the features offered by the `KeyUserConnector`, the `BtpServiceConnector` also allows you to use end-user personalization.

Action: If you develop apps running standalone on SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment, we strongly recommend that you replace the `KeyUserConnector` with the `BtpServiceConnector` in your SAPUI5 bootstrap.
