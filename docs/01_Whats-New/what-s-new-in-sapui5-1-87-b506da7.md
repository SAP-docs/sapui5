You can use the control to display long texts, for example, inside a table, list, or form. Only the first characters from the text field and a `More` link are shown initially, which allows the full text to be displayed. There are two options for displaying the full text, which are defined by the `overflowMode` property - in place \(default\) or as a popover. The `maxCharacters` property specifies the maximum number of characters from the beginning of the text field, that are shown initially. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.ExpandableText) and the [Samples](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.m.ExpandableText).

**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model**

The new version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model introduces the following features:

-   A new `additionally` property within the `group` map of the `$$aggregation` list binding parameter. This allows you to define properties that are fetched together with a group level, such as a text for a key. For more information, see [`sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding#setAggregation`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding/methods/setAggregation) and [Data Aggregation and Recursive Hierarchy](../04_Essentials/data-aggregation-and-recursive-hierarchy-7d91431.md).

-   Support of the `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#requestSideEffects` method in combination with kept-alive contexts. A list binding context can be kept alive with the `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#setKeepAlive` method introduced with SAPUI5 1.81.

-   Evaluation of the `Org.OData.Core.V1.ContentID` instance annotation in messages of error responses to change sets, so that the message can be assigned to the correct request and the message target can be calculated correctly. For more information, see [Server Messages in the OData V4 Model](../04_Essentials/server-messages-in-the-odata-v4-model-fbe1cb5.md).


For more information, see [OData V4 Model](../04_Essentials/odata-v4-model-5de13cf.md), the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4), and the [Samples](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel) in the Demo Kit.

<td valign="top">

**`sap.f.GridList`**

We have improved the keyboard handling capabilities of the control. Now, similar to `sap.f.GridContainer`, the navigation with [Arrow\] keys follows the cells of the underlying \(virtual\) grid. This behavior provides stable navigation paths if there are items of different sizes. When any of the borders are reached, the `borderReached` event is fired. To navigate to another `GridList`, you have two options:

-   Navigate using the [Tab\] key.

-   Configure navigation with the [Arrow\] keys. This is achieved by using the `focusItemByDirection` method and requires additional logic from the application side to determine the navigation direction in the actual app layout.


For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.f.GridList) and the [Samples](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.f.GridList).

While the keyboard focus is located on the title bar, the dialog can then be moved with the [Arrow\] keys and resized with [Shift\] + [Arrow\]  keys. For more information, see the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.m.Dialog/sample/sap.m.sample.Dialog).

**`sap.ui.comp.smartfield.SmartField`, `sap.ui.comp.smartform.SmartForm`**

`SmartForm` and `SmartField` now support the `importance` property. Based on this property, the `SmartForm` decides which `SmartFields` will be visible. This feature makes the `SmartForm` more flexible if you have limited screen real estate because it can display only the fields that are important for the user. The following options are available:

-   If the `SmartForm` has `high` importance, only smart fields with `high` importance will be visible.

-   If the `SmartForm` has `medium` importance, only smart fields with `high` and `medium` importance will be visible.

-   If the `SmartForm` has `low` importance \(default\), all smart fields will be visible, regardless of their importance.


> ### Note:  
> If a `SmartField` is annotated as `mandatory` or `hidden`, its visibility is not affected by the `importance` property.

The `SmartField` importance can also be set using the `UI.Importance` annotation. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.comp.smartfield.SmartField%23annotations/Importance) in the Demo Kit. 

If both the property and the annotation are set, the importance of the property is taken into account.

For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.comp.smartform.SmartForm) and the [Smart Form using Importance property Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.comp.smartform.SmartForm/sample/sap.ui.comp.sample.smartformImportance).

`SmartField` now supports values that are not part of the `ComboBox` list. As a result, such values are no longer shown as invalid and are now sent to the backend.

We have extended `sap.m.ComboBox` with our own control `sap.ui.comp.smartfield.ComboBox`. The bound property of the `SmartField` value of `sap.ui.comp.smartfield.ComboBox` is `enteredValue`. In this property, we store the `selectedKey` when a selection is made inside the `ComboBox` from `sap.m.List`, or a manually entered value.

We have done some fine-tuning regarding the handling of the column width for all supported table types: The `enableAutoColumnWidth` property, which enables the automatic resizing of columns, is no longer experimental. Column resizing now takes various factors into account, for example, long column header texts, the width of icons, or paddings of input fields in edit mode. End users can now also adjust the column size in responsive tables based on their specific needs.

For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.comp.smarttable.SmartTable%23methods/getEnableAutoColumnWidth) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.comp.smarttable.SmartTable/sample/sap.ui.comp.sample.smarttable).

For more information, see the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/object/arrayParameters) in the Card Explorer.

-   Two new experimental actions are now available in the Calendar card that you can use to set dynamic data fetching to be dependent of the selected date/month:

    -   `DateChange` – triggered when a date is selected.

    -   `MonthChange` – triggered when the currently displayed month is changed from the pickers or from the arrow buttons.


    Both `DateChange` and `MonthChange` actions are triggered when the `Today` button is pressed. For more information, see the [Samples](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/calendar/extension) and the [Calendar Card](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/types/calendar) section in the Card Explorer.
