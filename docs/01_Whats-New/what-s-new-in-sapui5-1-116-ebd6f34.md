**`sap.ui.comp.valuehelpdialog.ValueHelpDialog`**

We have provided an option to initially expand the filter bar and show all filters for dialogs that are created automatically \(based on OData annotations\):

-   For `ValueHelp` dialogs of the fields in the `SmartFilterBar`, and the `FilterPanel` of the `SmartTable`, custom data can be passed with the `defaultFilterBarExpanded` and `defaultShowAllFilters` properties. The values can be `Boolean` or `Object` \(with listed OData properties and their desired values\).
-   For ValueHelp dialogs of the SmartField, the same custom data can be passed, but only with the `Boolean` value type.
-   For custom implemented `ValueHelp` dialogs, you can use the`filterBarExpanded` and `showAllFilters` properties.

For more information, see the [Smart Filter Bar with Different Annotations](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.comp.smartfilterbar.SmartFilterBar/sample/sap.ui.comp.sample.smartfilterbar.Annotations), and the [Smart Field - TextInEditModeSource](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.comp.smartfield.SmartField/sample/sap.ui.comp.sample.smartfield.TextInEditModeSource) samples.

We have improved the placeholders of these controls in cases when the placeholders are not explicitly set. Previously the expected date format was used as a placeholder, but because it's a technical term, it could not be translated. Now the placeholder is a sample date in the required format, starting with *e.g.*, where *e.g.* is translatable.
