-   To improve usability, we have adapted the messages that are shown if no data is available. Different messages are shown depending on the following conditions:

    -   During the initial state of the chart and depending on whether there is a `sap.ui.comp.filterbar.FilterBar` control

    -   After a first back-end request if no data is available

    -   After a first back-end request if no data and no `FilterBar` are available


-   We have introduced the new `notAssignedText` property. The property can be used to provide a description for fields with an empty string.

    For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.comp.smartchart.SmartChart%23methods/getNotAssignedText) and the [Samples](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.comp.smartchart.SmartChart).

**SAP Fiori elements for OData V4**

The following changes and new features are available for SAP Fiori elements for OData V4:

-   We now provide the possibility to define a default action for menu buttons in list reports, object page headers, and forms. For more information, see the section *Defining a Default Action for a Menu Button* in [Actions](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/actions-cbf16c5.md).

-   You can now define default values for operators that require parameters, such as Next "X" Days. For more information, see [Enabling Semantic Operators in the Filter Bar](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/enabling-semantic-operators-in-the-filter-bar-fef65d0.md).

-   We've enabled the handling of side effects for the mass edit functionality. For more information, see [Enabling Editing Using a Dialog \(Mass Edit\)](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/enabling-editing-using-a-dialog-mass-edit-965ef5b.md).

**SAP Fiori elements for OData V2**

The following changes and new features are available for SAP Fiori elements for OData V2:

-   The global side effect is now triggered only from the fields of the entity where the side effect is defined. For more information, see [Using Global Side Effects](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/using-global-side-effects-955ae31.md).

-   We've now improved the content density so that the object page shows form data spread across six columns instead of four columns when opened on extra large screens. For more information, see [Defining and Adapting Sections](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/defining-and-adapting-sections-facfea0.md).

-   For the value help fields, a side effect is now triggered when the focus moves away from the source field group. For more information, see [Side Effects](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/side-effects-18b17bd.md) .

**`sap.ui.integration.widgets.Card`**

-   We have made the loading placeholder for Timeline card more detailed to better reveal the expected loading content. For more information, see the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.integration.widgets.Card/sample/sap.ui.integration.sample.LazyLoading).

-   We have \(experimentally\) enabled the Object card to validate the user input provided in the card form fields. As a card developer, using the available validation functions, you can now specify if the input is required, limit the number of characters, or restrict the input to some predefined options. You can also set the validation message and the validation type \(`Error`, `Warning`, or `Information`\). For more information, see the [Input Validation](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/features/inputValidation) section and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/object/formWithValidation) in the Card Explorer.

-   We have \(experimentally\) introduced new properties that enable you to format Object card content:

    -   `titleMaxLines` - limits the number of lines in which the group title will be wrapped.
    -   `labelWrapping` - a Boolean property that determines whether the labels of the group items will be wrapped.

    For more information, see the [Object Card](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/typesDeclarative/object) section and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/object/titleMaxLinesAndLabelWrapping) in the Card Explorer.

-   You can now control the visibility of List card item’s attributes using the new `visible` Boolean property.

    For more information, see the [List Card](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/typesDeclarative/list) section and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/list/attributesVisibility) in the Card Explorer.

To do so, you can select *Custom Range* within *Time Range* while using *Filter By*. The time zone can either be passed using the configuration or specified using an annotation from a back-end service. If no time zone is maintained or if the time zone is invalid, the date/time is set to the local time zone.

**Deactivation of Default Time Zone Configuration Feature** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

**Deactivation of Default Time Zone Configuration Feature**

We needed to deactivate the feature to configure the default time zone via the time zone configuration option in [`sap.ui.core.Configuration`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.Configuration) and the API method [`sap.ui.core.Configuration.setTimezone`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.Configuration/methods/setTimezone). Reason: There was a risk that dates are visualized by one day off. This wrong date might have been persisted to the back end.

This feature was introduced with UI5 1.102.0. The following UI5 versions still contain this feature:

-   1.102.0 to 1.102.5
-   1.103
-   1.104

If you are on one of these releases, we recommend that you upgrade to a higher version where this feature is deactivated.

Deactivated as of:

-   1.106

-   1.105

-   1.102.6


We plan to bring this feature back in a different form at a later point in time.
