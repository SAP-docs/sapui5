**`sap.m.List`**

-   To improve accessibility, we have replaced the existing ARIA roles. The following new default roles are available:

    -   `role=list` for lists

    -   `role=listitem` for list items


-   We have also improved the accessibility for the group headers of grouped lists by, for example, adding the ARIA role `role=group`.

**Stricter Validation of Decimal and Grouping Separators**

> ### Note:  
> The following information concerns important upcoming changes for end users. These changes may require end users to adjust and/or test cases to be adapted, but they won't stop or disrupt software or processes.

If a user added grouping separators when entering a number, the parsing logic ignored them. This could result in an unwanted number if the user confused grouping separators and decimal separators. Since SAPUI5 1.99, the grouping separators are checked against the current locale to largely prevent that the user confuses these types of separators.

**Deactivation of Default Time Zone Configuration Feature**

> ### Note:  
> The following information concerns important upcoming changes for end users. These changes may require end users to adjust and/or test cases to be adapted, but they won't stop or disrupt software or processes.

We needed to deactivate the feature to configure the default time zone via the time zone configuration option in [`sap.ui.core.Configuration`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.Configuration) and the API method [`sap.ui.core.Configuration.setTimezone`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.Configuration/methods/setTimezone). Reason: There was a risk that dates are visualized by one day off. This wrong date might have been persisted to the back end.

This feature was introduced with UI5 1.102.0. The following UI5 versions still contain this feature:

-   1.102.0 to 1.102.5
-   1.103
-   1.104

If you are on one of these releases, we recommend that you upgrade to a higher version where this feature is deactivated.

Deactivated as of:

-   1.106

-   1.105

-   1.102.6


We plan to bring this feature back in a different form at a later point in time.
