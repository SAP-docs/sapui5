# Overview Page Card

A card is a smart component that uses UI annotation to render its content. It contains a header area and a footer area.



Each card is bound to a single entity set in a data source, and its configuration is provided in the `"sap.ovp"..."cards"` object. The cards object contains the list of cards to display in the application.

The card ID is the property name, and the card configuration is provided as a value in the object. At runtime, the cards are displayed in the order that they appear in the application descriptor.

For more information on cards and its areas, see [Card](https://experience.sap.com/fiori-design-web/cards/).

## Card Header

All cards have a static header section that can be configured in the descriptor configuration file. The card header includes the following properties: `category`, `title`, `subTitle` and card actions.

The `title` property is mandatory. The `subTitle` is only mandatory if the card contains data point annotations \(such as a KPI header\). The title and subtitle can contain a maximum of two lines. The header also contains a counter showing how many records are presented in the card out of the total existing records, according to the current filter.

> ### Note:  
> The counter is only displayed on table and list cards. For more information, see [Table Cards](table-cards-167bf7c.md) and [List Cards](list-cards-56f39e0.md).

> ### Sample Code:  
> ```
> "sap.ovp": {
>     "_version": "1.1.0",
>     "globalFilterModel": "ZCD204_EPM_DEMO_SRV",
>     "globalFilterEntityType": "SalesOrder",
>     "cards": {
>         "card00": {
>             "model": "ZCD204_EPM_DEMO_SRV",
>             "template": "sap.ovp.cards.stack",
>             "settings": {
>                 ...
>                 "category": "{{card00_category}}",
>                 "title": "{{card00_title}}",
>                 "subTitle ": "{{card00_subTitle}}",
>                 ...
>             }
>         },
>         "card01": {
>             "model": "ZCD204_EPM_DEMO_SRV",
>             "template": "sap.ovp.cards.table",
>             "settings": {
>                 "title": "{{card01_category}}",
>                 ...
>             }
>         },
>         ...
>     }
> }
> ```



### **KPI Headers**

The generic card provides a dynamic section that can display a key performance indicator \(KPI\) and related information in the header. The KPI is an aggregated value, as defined in the annotation file. To display a KPI header in a card, make sure that your OData service supports aggregation of values and the data is coming from the backend only. The KPI header can contain a KPI value, including its unit of measure, its trend, percentage of change, and KPI header description.

The KPI extension uses the following annotation terms:

-   `com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.DataPoint`: Used to retrieve information about the title and the value of the KPI.
-   `com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.PresentationVariant`: Used to retrieve information about the fields which are used for grouping and sorting information.
-   `com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.SelectionVariant`: Used to retrieve information about the filters.

> ### Note:  
> For more information about these annotations, see [Annotations Used in Overview Pages](annotations-used-in-overview-pages-65731e6.md).

These annotation terms can be configured in the application manifest file, as shown in the following example:

> ### Sample Code:  
> ```
> 
> "sap.ovp": {
>     ...
>     "cards": {
>         ...
>         "card02": {
>             "model": "ZCD204_EPM_DEMO_SRV",
>             "template": "sap.ovp.cards.charts.bubble",
>             "settings": {
>                 "entitySet": "SalesOrders",
>                 "identificationAnnotationPath": "com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.Identification#bubble",
>                 "selectionAnnotationPath": "com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.SelectionVariant#bubble",
>                 "chartAnnotationPath": "com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.Chart#bubble",
>                 "presentationAnnotationPath": "com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.PresentationVariant#bubble",
>                 "dataPointAnnotationPath": "com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.DataPoint#bubble"
>             }
>         },
>         ...
>     }
> }
> 
> ```

## Card Actions

Card actions are available as of SAPUI5 1.110. You can access and perform the card actions from the card header. The following card actions are available:

-   *Refresh*: this action retrieves the entity bound to the card and reloads the card, displaying the latest data.

-   *Add Card to Insights*: this action shows a preview of the card so that it can be added to the *Insights* section directly from the overview. Note that this action is only available if the *Insights* service is enabled.

-   *Manage Cards*: this action opens the *Manage Cards* dialog where you can hide or show the available cards.

## Cards in *Insights*

You can add and use the analytical, list and table cards within the *Insights* section of **My Home** in SAP S/4HANA Cloud. The objective of displaying cards on the entry page is to visualize charts, KPIÂ´s and counters in the form of interest cards.

To add a card to the *Insights* section, select the *More* option from the card and choose *Add Card to Insights*. In the subsequent dialog box, you can update the card's *Title* and the *Subtitle*. Click *Add* to display the card in the *Insights* section.

Note that only eight cards at a time can be displayed in the *Insights* section. If the maximum number of cards is already displayed on the entry page, the selected card is added to the *Edit Insights* dialog box. You can choose to select or deselect cards by editing the *Insights* section. For more information, see [**My Home** in SAP S/4HANA Cloud](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/4fc8d03390c342da8a60f8ee387bca1a/8a60279e8d2041b5ad8d3455fab0f3ef.html).



### Disabling Card Generation

An application can also restrict the generation of individual analytical, list, and table cards. To do this, you can configure the card manifest setting by turning `enableAddToInsights` to `false`. This removes the option to add cards to the *Insights* section.

> ### Sample Code:  
> ```
> "card01": {
>         "model": "MODEL",
>         "template": "sap.ovp.cards.charts.analytical",
>         "settings": {
>           "title": "{{card01_title}}",
>           "subTitle": "{{card01_subTitle}}",
>           "entitySet": "C_EntitySet",
>           "enableAddToInsights": false,
>           "selectionAnnotationPath": "com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.SelectionVariant#SV",
>           "chartAnnotationPath": "com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.Chart#Chart",
>           "presentationAnnotationPath": "com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.PresentationVariant#PV",
>           "dataPointAnnotationPath": "com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.DataPoint#DP",
>           "identificationAnnotationPath": "com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.Identification"
>         }
>       },
> ```

> ### Note:  
> If custom navigation is enabled for a card, navigation from the *Insights* section of **My Home** for that card leads to the parent overview page application instead of the target maintained in the overview page card.
