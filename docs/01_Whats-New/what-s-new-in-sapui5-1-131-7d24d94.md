**`sap.ui.mdc.Table`**

-   To collapse/expand either an entire node or an entire tree in tables with `TreeTableType`, we have introduced a `MenuButton`. For each functionality, the related function must be implemented in the configuration object of `TableDelegate`. For OData V4, we have already implemented this as a default functionality. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/module:sap/ui/mdc/TableDelegate%23methods/sap/ui/mdc/TableDelegate.fetchExpandAndCollapseConfiguration).

-   We have enabled sticky group headers by default for tables with `ResponsiveTableType`. Group headers now remain in a fixed position at the top of the page during vertical scrolling. For more information, see the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.mdc.Table/sample/sap.ui.mdc.demokit.sample.table.TableJson).

**Improved Focus Handling in SAPUI5**

Whenever a UI5 element loses focus due to becoming disabled, invisible, or destroyed, the focus now automatically shifts to the next logical element, ensuring improved navigation and accessibility. Control developers can customize this behavior by overriding the default `onfocusfail` handler to meet specific control requirements.

For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.Element%23methods/onfocusfail).

-   You can now set default values for semantic options in dynamic date range filters. You can manage this in the smart filter bar `ControlConfiguration`, where you can adjust the default value for this operation. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.comp.smartfilterbar.SmartFilterBar) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.comp.smartfilterbar.SmartFilterBar/sample/sap.ui.comp.sample.smartfilterbar.UseDateRangeType).

-   The basic search feature is now limited to 1000 characters, including spaces, to improve performance. If the input exceeds this limit, a `valueState` error appears, and the search isn't triggered. This restriction applies to both standalone smart filter bar and smart filter bar within a value help dialog. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.comp.smartfilterbar.SmartFilterBar%23controlProperties) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.comp.smartfilterbar.SmartFilterBar/sample/sap.ui.comp.sample.smartfilterbar.Basic).
