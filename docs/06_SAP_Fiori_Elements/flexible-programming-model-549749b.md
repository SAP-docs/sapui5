# Flexible Programming Model

SAP Fiori elements for OData V4 offers multiple ways to extend applications according to your specific requirements.

The flexible programming model provides a range of options for this, eliminating the need for a rigid choice between SAP Fiori elements and freestyle SAPUI5 development.

While you have the freedom to use any SAPUI5 coding or controls in extension points, you can also make use of our building blocks and controller extensions to enhance your application.

You can even create a custom app that runs on the SAP Fiori elements framework, where all pages are treated like custom pages.

For more information and live examples, see [Flexible Programming Model](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/fe/core/fpmExplorer/index.html#/overview/introduction).
