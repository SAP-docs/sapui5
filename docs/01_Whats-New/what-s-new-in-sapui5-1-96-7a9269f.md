**Enabling Apps to Comply with a Content Security Policy \(CSP\) without `eval()` and Inline Styles**

The SAPUI5 framework now allows you to run applications in environments with stricter CSPs. Large parts of SAPUI5 don't require `eval()` or similar functions, as well as inline styles, any longer. For details about the supported policies as well as recommendations on writing CSP-compliant applications, see [Content Security Policy](../05_Developing_Apps/content-security-policy-fe1a6db.md).

> ### Note:  
> To run in a CSP-enabled environment, your apps need to be prepared for the policy used. See [Content Security Policy](../05_Developing_Apps/content-security-policy-fe1a6db.md).

> ### Note:  
> The following information concerns important changes for end users. These changes may require end users to adjust and/or test cases to be adapted, but they won't stop or disrupt software or processes.

Responsive tables with a multi-select option will show a *Clear All* checkbox instead of a *Select All* checkbox. This is the same behavior as in other table types.

**SAPUI5 Models**

We have provided the new `sap.ui.model.ListBinding#getFilters` method. It is available in all list bindings inheriting from `sap.ui.model.ListBinding`, for example in `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding` and `sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataListBinding`. We also provide getters for `sap.ui.model.Filter`.

<td valign="top">

**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model**

The new version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model introduces the following features:

-   You can now specify `$select` in addition to the `$$inheritExpandSelect` binding parameter of [OData Operations](../04_Essentials/odata-operations-b54f789.md).

-   We have complemented the [OData V4 Tutorial](../03_Get-Started/odata-v4-tutorial-bcdbde6.md) with additional chapters showing how to reuse data in a list-detail scenario.

-   You can now use [`Common.ValueListWithFixedValues`](https://github.com/SAP/odata-vocabularies/blob/main/vocabularies/Common.xml#L672:~:text=%3CTerm%20Name=%22-,ValueListWithFixedValues,-%22) in combination with [`Common.ValueListRelevantQualifiers`](https://github.com/SAP/odata-vocabularies/blob/main/vocabularies/Common.xml#L666:~:text=%3CTerm%20Name=%22-,ValueListRelevantQualifiers,-%22) if only one value list qualifier is relevant at a time. The `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataMetaModel#requestValueListInfo` method returns the relevant value list for the `""` qualifier and provides the original qualifier as the `$qualifier` property of the value list mapping.

**`sap.ui.comp.smartfield.SmartField`**

-   `SmartField` now shows by default multiple consecutive whitespace characters for string-based properties in display mode. Until now, the browser was merging whitespace characters into one single whitespace instead of displaying the original string. For more information, see [Whitespaces Concept](../05_Developing_Apps/whitespaces-concept-37deb0b.md). 

-   `SmartField` now supports the `Common.ValueListRelevantQualifiers` annotation. This annotation can limit the number of value list qualifiers based on a specific context determined by a property different from the annotated property. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.comp.smartfield.SmartField%23annotations/ValueListRelevantQualifiers) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.comp.smartfield.SmartField/sample/sap.ui.comp.sample.smartfield.ContextDependentValueHelp).

**`sap.ui.integration.widgets.Card`**

-   The List and Table cards now allow their content items to be grouped. You can use the new `group` manifest extension to configure the titles of the groups and the order of the items in these groups. For more information, see the [List Card](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/types/list) section and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/list/grouping) in the Card Explorer.

-   List cards now support attributes on an item level. They can show up to six attributes of their items’ attributes, which are displayed in one or two columns. For more information, see the [List Card](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/types/list) section and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/list/attributes) in the Card Explorer.

-   We have added a new `configurationChange` event, which is fired when some configuration settings are changed as a result of user interaction \(for example - filter change\). For more information, see the [Integration Cards API](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/integrate/api) section and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/configurationChanges) in the Card Explorer.

-   We have introduced a new `sideIndicatorsAlignment` property to the `sap.f.cards.NumericHeader`. This property controls the alignment of the side indicators in the numeric header. It can have two values `Begin` \(default\) or `End`. For more information, see the [Numeric Header](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/headers/numeric) section in the Card Explorer.

The following changes and new features are available for SAP Fiori elements for OData V4 and SAP Fiori elements for OData V2:

-   You can now create a global filter bar using the SAP Fiori elements for OData V4 service for an overview page application. Use the filter bar to create a filter. An automatic switch occurs to the filter bar when the `globalFilterModel` is defined as OData V4 model. Currently, filtering on the cards, variant management, and value list annotation is supported.

**SAP Fiori elements for OData V4**

The following changes and new features are available for SAP Fiori elements for OData V4:

-   Application developers can now use the following building blocks:

    -   Paginator

    -   Chart

Application developers can then add custom code when the application is suspended or restored during an external navigation. For more information, see [Refresh Entity Sets in sap-keep-alive Mode](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/refresh-entity-sets-in-sap-keep-alive-mode-3c65f2c.md) and [Refresh Data Set for Back Navigation When sap-keep-alive Is Set to True](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/refresh-data-set-for-back-navigation-when-sap-keep-alive-is-set-to-true-f1c2704.md).

-   Draft-enabled applications now have an additional entry in the *Editing Status* on the filter bar in the list report: *All \(Hiding Drafts\)*. For more information, see [Toggling Between Draft and Saved Values](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/toggling-between-draft-and-saved-values-fd3950a.md).

-   Icons on an `Edm.Stream` property are now mime-type specific. For more information, see [Different Representations of a Field](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/different-representations-of-a-field-c18ada4.md).

-   The message popover now displays error messages for a custom column of a table. For more information, see [Extension Points for Tables](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/extension-points-for-tables-d525522.md).
