-   We've adapted the copy and paste function of the smart filter bar. Now, if the content of more than one column in a table is pasted into a filter field with multiple values, only the content of the first column is copied from the clipboard.

-   Until now, NUMC filters were not showing 0 as a value. Now, we have introduced the `<Empty>` operator for such fields. You can select the `<Empty>` or `!<Empty>` operator in the condition panel of the value help dialog that sends 0 as a value for the filter field. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.comp.smartfilterbar.SmartFilterBar).

-   We've improved timestamp fields. Now, if you send a date and time in a filter query, it includes an interval based on the precision defined in the field and takes milliseconds into account.

-   Until now, the smart filter bar `navigationProperties` property only supported listing `navigationProperty` names separated by commas. Now, the support is enhanced to include the listing of separate filters from different navigation properties. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.comp.smartfilterbar.SmartFilterBar).

-   We've enhanced the support for `OUT` and `InOut` parameters for `sap.m.DynamicDateRange`. Now, the `ValueList` annotation of a `String` field supports `ValueListParameterInOut` records with `LocalDataProperty` `sap.m.DynamicDateRange` \(interval\) as a source and `ValueListProperty sap.m.DatePicker` \(single\) as a destination.

**SAP Fiori elements for OData V2**

The following changes and new features are available for SAP Fiori elements for OData V2:

-   Table types are now displayed on mobile devices. This means that there's no need to automatically switch to responsive tables when the app is launched on mobile devices. For more information, see [Tables](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/tables-c0f6592.md).

-   List report applications now support the creation of insights cards from responsive tables in multiview scenarios. For more information, see [Creating Cards for the Insights Section of My Home in SAP S/4HANA Cloud](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/creating-cards-for-the-insights-section-of-my-home-in-sap-s-4hana-cloud-9b13559.md)

-   You can now hide the section title in a custom section, and sections with reuse components, using the `setAsTitleOwner` extension API . For more information, see [Placing Reuse Component Instances on the Object Page](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/placing-reuse-component-instances-on-the-object-page-1ba7f88.md), [Adding a Section to an Object Page](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/adding-a-section-to-an-object-page-a357047.md).

-   You can now display a message strip with a custom message in the object page header. For more information, see [Extension Points for Object Page Header Facets](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/extension-points-for-object-page-header-facets-61cf0ee.md).

-   We've introduced the following keys that allow application developers to add a tooltip to the pagination buttons using the custom `i18n` file approach:

    -   `T_PAGINATOR_CONTROL_PAGINATOR_TOOLTIP_UP`
    -   `T_PAGINATOR_CONTROL_PAGINATOR_TOOLTIP_DOWN`

    For more information, see [Localization of UI Texts](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/localization-of-ui-texts-b8cb649.md).

-   You can now incorporate the column header in the column width calculation to avoid truncated column labels. For more information, see [Setting the Default Column Width](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/setting-the-default-column-width-a765253.md).

-   Information coming from a navigation entity that is associated with the control is no longer a part of the navigation context that is passed during external navigation. This reduces the overall load of information that needs to be passed. For more information, see [Navigation from an App \(Outbound Navigation\)](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/navigation-from-an-app-outbound-navigation-d782acf.md).

-   We now support the use of the `Common.IsNaturalPerson` annotation with an entity and other annotations such as `UI.IsImage` and `UI.IsImageUrl`. For more information, see [Enabling Stream Support](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/enabling-stream-support-b236d32.md).

-   You can now define and hide the table header using the `manifest.json`. For more information, see [Setting the Table Header](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/setting-the-table-header-f996207.md).

-   We now ensure that charts and analytical tables support the parameterized entity. For more information, see [Configuring Filter Bars](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/configuring-filter-bars-4bd7590.md).

-   You can now use the manifest setting `openInEditMode` to open an object page in edit mode. For more information, see [Navigation to an Object Page in Edit Mode](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/navigation-to-an-object-page-in-edit-mode-8665847.md).

-   The `Chart` building block now supports `getter` and `setter` methods to get and set the chart state using the `PresentationVariant` format. For more information, see [The Chart Building Block](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/the-chart-building-block-52d065a.md).

-   The `Table` building block now supports `getter` and `setter` methods to get and set the chart state using the `PresentationVariant` format. For more information, see [The Table Building Block](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/the-table-building-block-3801656.md).

-   The `Table` building block now supports analytical tables. For more information, see [The Table Building Block](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/the-table-building-block-3801656.md).

-   You can now enhance the request of the `Table` building block before rebinding it. For more information, see [Influencing the Request Dynamically](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/influencing-the-request-dynamically-2cc6c03.md).

-   You can now define a tooltip for custom columns in the manifest settings. For more information, see [Extension Points for Tables](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/extension-points-for-tables-d525522.md).

-   You can now use the `SelectionPresentationVariant` annotation in an object page table. For more information, see [Defining and Adapting Sections](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/defining-and-adapting-sections-facfea0.md).

We've introduced the `illustratedMessage` as an aggregation of `UploadSet`. You can now customize `illustratedMessage` when there is no data in the `UploadSet`. A default `illustratedMessage` is retained if specific descriptions are not available.

As a part of this update, we have deprecated the `noDataText`, `noDataDescription`, and `noDataIllustrationType` properties. Simultaneously, we have introduced a new aggregation, `illustratedMessage` of type `sap.m.IllustratedMessage`. You can implement this by directly adding it as an aggregation within `UploadSet`.

For more information, see the [Combo Box Filter](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/filters/comboBox) section and [ComboBox](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/comboBoxFilter) sample in the Card Explorer.
-   We have \(experimentally\) introduced an additional option to define actions-strip buttons in a list item or in a footer. It allows you to dynamically set specific actions for each list item in the List card. They can now be defined with a template, and can be based on the fetched data from a back-end service. For more information, see the [Actions Strip](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/features/actionsStrip) section and [Dynamic Actions Strip](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/list/dynamicActionsStrip) sample in the Card Explorer.
-   We have \(experimentally\) added an option to set group labels for one or more actions-strip buttons. For more information, see the [Actions Strip](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/features/actionsStrip) section and [Actions Labels](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/list/actionsLabels) sample in the Card Explorer.
-   We have introduced a new `preferIcon` property for the actions-strip buttons. If set to `true`, the button in the visible area is displayed only as an icon. This feature saves space in the actions strip. For more information, see the [Actions Strip](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/features/actionsStrip) section in the Card Explorer.
-   The following features are no longer experimental:

    -   Search filter
    -   CSRF tokens \(with new binding syntax\)
    -   Actions strip
    -   Card footer

    For more information, see the [Learn](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/gettingStarted) section in the Card Explorer.

-   We have \(experimentally\) enabled the Object card to show an image with text overlay. There are multiple new properties available that you can use to control how the image is displayed and the overlay behavior of the texts. For more information, see the [Object Card](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/typesDeclarative/object) section and [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/object/objectCardWithImageWithOverlay) in the Card Explorer.

**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model**

The new version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model introduces the following features:

-   You can now use aliases for computed annotations in XML views. Use `template:require` or `<template:alias>` during templating and `core:require` in XML views for defining your aliases. Note that we no longer recommend using global names for computed annotations in XML views or during templating.

    For more information, see [Require Modules in XML View and Fragment](../04_Essentials/require-modules-in-xml-view-and-fragment-b11d853.md) and [Meta Model for OData V4](../04_Essentials/meta-model-for-odata-v4-7f29fb3.md).

-   You can now explicitly provide `$single` as a new group ID to`sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#delete`, `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel#delete`, and `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataContextBinding#execute`. Requests will then be sent as fast as with `$direct`, but they will be wrapped in a batch request as with `$auto`.

    For more information, see the API Reference for [`v4.Context#delete`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context%23methods/delete), [`v4.ODataModel#delete`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel%23methods/delete), and [`v4.ODataContextBinding#execute`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataContextBinding%23methods/execute).
