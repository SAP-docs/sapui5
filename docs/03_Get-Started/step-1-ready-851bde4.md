# Step 1: Ready...

Let's get you ready for your journey! We bootstrap SAPUI5 in an HTML page and implement a simple "Hello World" example.

## Setup

Install UI5 Tooling globally on your local machine by executing following command `npm install --global @ui5/cli`.

## Coding

You can view and download all files at [Quick Start - Step 1](https://ui5.sap.com/#/sample/sap.m.tutorial.quickstart.01/preview).

1.  Create a folder on your local machine which will contain all the sources of the app we're going to build. We'll refer to this folder as the “app root folder”.
2.  Create a new file called `package.json` which will enable you to execute commands and consume packages from the[npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/) via the npm command line interface. Enter the following content:

    **package.json \(New\)**

    ```
    {
      "name": "ui5.quickstart",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "description": "The UI5 quickstart tutorial",
      "scripts": {
          "start": "ui5 serve -o index.html"
      }
    }
    
    ```

3.  Create a new folder named `webapp` in the app root folder. It will contain all the sources that become available in the browser later. We'll refer to this folder as the "webapp folder".

4.  Create a new HTML file named `index.html` in your webapp folder and enter the following content:

    **webapp/index.html \(New\)**

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
    	<meta charset="utf-8">
    	<title>Quickstart Tutorial</title>
    	<script id="sap-ui-bootstrap"
    		src="resources/sap-ui-core.js"
    		data-sap-ui-libs="sap.m"
    		data-sap-ui-compat-version="edge"
    		data-sap-ui-async="true"
    		data-sap-ui-on-init="module:ui5/quickstart/index"
    		data-sap-ui-resource-roots='{
    			"ui5.quickstart": "./"
    		}'>
    	</script>
    </head>
    <body class="sapUiBody" id="content"></body>
    </html>
    ```

    With the `script` tag, we load and initialize SAPUI5 with typical bootstrap parameters. We define, for example, a theme, control libraries, as well as performance and compatibility flags.

    First, we need a source to load SAPUI5 from. In this tutorial, we will use UI5 Tooling to host the OpenUI5 resources.

    The bootstrap property `resourceroots` defines the namespace for all resources of the app. This way, we can easily reference additional files that we are about to create in this step.

    The `index` module that we load with the `onInit` parameter will hold the application logic.

    The `body` tag is defined with the `sapUiBody` class and the `content` ID. This is where we will add the content of the app in the next steps.

5.  In your `webapp` folder, create a new file `index.js` that will be called as soon as SAPUI5 is loaded and initialized.

    **webapp/index.js \(New\)**

    ```js
    sap.ui.define([
    	"sap/m/Button",
    	"sap/m/MessageToast"
    ], (Button, MessageToast) => {
    	"use strict";
    
    	new Button({
    		text: "Ready...",
    		press() {
    			MessageToast.show("Hello World!");
    		}
    	}).placeAt("content");
    
    });
    ```

    We load two UI controls - a button and a message toast - and place the button in the element with the `content` ID. The button is defined with a `text` property and a callback attached to its `press` event.

6.  Create a new file named `manifest.json` in the webapp folder; it's also known as the "app descriptor". All application-specific configuration options which we'll introduce in this tutorial will be added to this file. Enter the following content:

    **webapp/manifest.json \(New\)**

    ```
    {
      "_version": "1.58.0",
      "sap.app": {
        "id": "ui5.quickstart"
      }
    }
    ```

7.  Open a terminal in the app root folder and execute `npm i -D @ui5/cli` to install UI5 Tooling.

8.  Execute `ui5 init` in the app root folder.

9.  Execute `ui5 use OpenUI5`

10. Execute `ui5 add sap.m sap.tnt sap.ui.core sap.ui.layout themelib_sap_horizon`

11. Execute `npm start` to start the web server and to open a new browser window hosting your newly created `index.html`.
