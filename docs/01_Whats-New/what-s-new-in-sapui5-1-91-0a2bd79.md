**SAPUI5 OData V2 Model**

A `Content-ID` header has been added to all non-read requests in a batch request. For failing change sets, the `Content-ID` of individual messages in the error response is used to map the message to the correct request. This allows you to calculate the correct target.

**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model**

The new version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model introduces the following features:

-   For a list binding with visual grouping, that is with a `groupLevels` list provided in the `$$aggregation` binding parameter, you can now request the `$count` parameter. The resulting count represents the number of records at the leaf level. The `$count` parameter can be accessed through the header context as described in [Binding Collection Inline Count](../04_Essentials/binding-collection-inline-count-77d2310.md).

-   We now provide a new `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding#getCount` method that allows you to get the count of elements or leaves in your collection.For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding/methods/getCount).

**New Data Type Property for Spreadsheet Export**

The additional `utc` property is now available for date and time information. It determines whether column definitions of type `sap.ui.export.EdmType.Date/DateTime/Time` are exported as UTC time or as the local time of the user.For more information, see [Spreadsheet Export](../04_Essentials/spreadsheet-export-2691788.md), the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.export.Spreadsheet/overview), and the [Samples](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.export.Spreadsheet).

**`sap.m.App`**

Until now, `sap.m.App` assumed that it wasn't nested and always appeared as the top-level root DOM element for apps. With the new `isTopLevel` property, you can now disable this behavior for different use cases, such as nested components and standalone usage.For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.App).

**`sap.ui.comp.smartfield.SmartField`**

The `SmartField` control now supports currency and unit of measure custom lists in the model. In these custom lists you can define supported currency and units of measure, and decimal number requirements. This function is enabled by adding the `com.sap.vocabularies.CodeList.v1.CurrencyCodes` annotation for currency and `com.sap.vocabularies.CodeList.v1.UnitsOfMeasure` for units of measure. Once the annotations are added, `SmartField` handles the validation and formatting of the values according to the definitions in the list.
