**New Event Handler Parameter Syntax**

<td valign="top">

**New Event Handler Parameter Syntax**

When event handlers are assigned to control events in XML views, you can now also specify parameters which can be passed to the event handler. The parameters can be static values as well as bindings and even expressions. This feature helps to reduce controller code and avoid unnecessary controller methods, and separates the controller logic from the retrieval of the required input values.

```xml
<Button text="Add Product" press=".modifyList('add ', ${products>unitPrice})"/>
```

For more information, see [Handling Events in XML Views](../04_Essentials/handling-events-in-xml-views-b0fb4de.md).

**XML Composite Control**

A new type of composite control, the XML composite control, is now available. It let's you build more flexible controls that contain separate XML and JavaScript parts. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.XMLComposite) and the [Samples](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.core.XMLComposite).

**Support Assistant**

The Support Assistant now allows you to import and export your rule selection. This helps you when you want to perform more than one analysis with the same subset of selected rules. The selection is exported as a `.json` file with a title and description of your choice. You can then import this file and load it whenever you want to execute the same rules in another analysis.

**`sap.suite.ui.commons.CalculationBuilder`**

Enables you to perform arithmetic calculations on constants and variables, using standard arithmetic operators and the most common logical operators and functions. You can customize the sets of variables and functions that are visible in the calculation builder and introduce your own custom functions, as needed. Arithmetic expressions can be entered using a touch-friendly visual editor or a textual editor that provides autocomplete suggestions for variables and checks the expression syntax as you type.

For more information, see [Calculation Builder](../10_More_About_Controls/calculation-builder-1db5047.md), the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.suite.ui.commons.CalculationBuilder) and the [Samples](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.suite.ui.commons.CalculationBuilder).

**`sap.ui.comp.smartmultiinput.SmartMultiInput`**

Acts as a wrapper control for `sap.ui.comp.smartfield.SmartField` and supports the same settings and annotations. It interprets OData metadata to create a multi-input field or a multi-input combobox, similar to `sap.m.MultiInput` and `sap.m.MultiComboBox`, but with added annotation capabilities. Thanks to the annotation support, smart multi-input fields and comboboxes can be embedded into other smart controls, such as `sap.ui.comp.smartform.SmartForm`.

For more information, see [Smart Multi Input](../10_More_About_Controls/smart-multi-input-5644169.md), the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.comp.smartmultiinput.SmartMultiInput) and the [Samples](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.comp.smartmultiinput.SmartMultiInput).

**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model**

The new version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model has the following features:

-   Binding parameter `$$ownRequest` to enforce that a binding sends its own requests.

-   Binding parameter `$$aggregation` to display aggregated data.

    > ### Note:  
    > This feature is still a work in progress. So far it supports displaying a flat list of aggregated data or grouping by one groupable property without being able to expand.

-   The refresh of a single row in an absolute list binding can now also take filters into account .

-   When executing a deferred bound operation, the result of the promise returned by `v4.ODataContextBinding#execute` is the context representing the data of the bound operation response if certain conditions are fulfilled. For more information check the API for <code><a href="https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataContextBinding/methods/execute"><code>ODataContextBinding#execute</code></a></code>.


> ### Restriction:  
> Due to the limited feature scope of this version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, check that all required features are in place before developing applications. Check the detailed documentation of the features, as certain parts of a feature may be missing. While we aim to be compatible with existing controls, some controls might not work due to small incompatibilities compared to `sap.ui.model.odata.(v2.)ODataModel`, or due to missing features in the model \(such as tree binding\). This also applies to smart controls \(`sap.ui.comp` library\) and SAP Fiori elements that do not support the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, as well as controls such as `TreeTable` and `AnalyticalTable`, which are not supported together with the SAPUI5 OData V4 model. The interface for applications has been changed for easier and more efficient use of the model. For a summary of these changes, see [Changes Compared to OData V2 Model](../04_Essentials/changes-compared-to-odata-v2-model-abd4d7c.md).

For more information, see [OData V4 Model](../04_Essentials/odata-v4-model-5de13cf.md), the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4), and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel) in the Demo Kit.

**Support Assistant**

-   `sap.ui.support.ExecutionScope.getElements` has a new parameter `cloned`. It allows users of the Support Assistant to filter out elements that are clones of list bindings. Now the results will include only the representative clone. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.support.ExecutionScope/methods/Summary).

-   A *Filter* view showing the currently applied filter has been added to the *Issues* view of the Support Assistant. The *Clear Filtering* button \(![](images/Clear_filter_icon_4a0cf3b.png)\) has moved to the *Filter* view. It is active only when there is a filter selected.

-   An explanatory note has been added to the *Additional Rulesets* view under the header to give more clarity about the function of these rulesets and why they are in a separate tab.

-   The *Report* button is now fixed to the panel to be always visible and not to get into the overflow.

-   The font sizes are aligned across all three views for consistency.

-   In the *Issues* view the number of issues is only highlighted when there are issues of medium and high severity. This improvement helps to easily see the distribution of the issues by severity.

When you click the *Bird Eye* button, the Gantt chart intelligently uses the best zoom rate to display shapes in all the rows, visible rows, or a specific row.The expand/collapse arrow and the pin/unpin buttons now have a new visual design. They are centered at the bottom header border next to each other. The interaction behavior is improved and you can now collapse a pinned header with a title tap or click or by choosing the expand/collapse arrow. This means that the pinned state now prevents the header from collapsing only when the user is scrolling the page.

-   The new `appointmentDragEnter` event allows appointments to be dragged and dropped between calendar rows. By default, when the `enableAppointmentDragAndDrop` property is enabled, appointments can be dragged only within their original `PlanningCalendarRow`. When `enableAppointmentsDragAndDrop` is set to true, attaching the event handler to the `appointmentDragEnter` event can change the default behavior and allow appointments to be dragged on the same row and between calendar rows.

-   Appointments can now be created in one `PlanningCalendarRow` by dragging with the mouse on an empty cell. This behavior is enabled with the `enableAppointmentCreate` boolean property. When creating is finished, an `appointmentCreate` event is fired.

-   The new `enableAppointmentResize` boolean property provides the possibility to resize appointments in one `PlanningCalendarRow`. When resizing is finished, an `appointmentResize` event is fired.

-   A new functionality to copy appointments by dragging them is added on the `PlanningCalendarRow` level. When you press [Ctrl\]/[Cmd\] while dragging an appointment, dropping it will create a copy.For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.PlanningCalendarRow) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/sample/sap.m.sample.PlanningCalendarDnD/preview).
