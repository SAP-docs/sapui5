Application developers can now customize the custom toolbar and remove the buttons that are not needed in the `RichTextEditor`. You can redefine the button group configuration to show only a particular set of buttons in the custom toolbar. For more information, see [sap.ui.richtexteditor](../10_More_About_Controls/sap-ui-richtexteditor-d4f3f15.md) and the [Samples](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.richtexteditor.RichTextEditor).

**Deactivation of Default Time Zone Configuration Feature** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

**Deactivation of Default Time Zone Configuration Feature**

We needed to deactivate the feature to configure the default time zone via the time zone configuration option in [`sap.ui.core.Configuration`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.Configuration) and the API method [`sap.ui.core.Configuration.setTimezone`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.Configuration/methods/setTimezone). Reason: There was a risk that dates are visualized by one day off. This wrong date might have been persisted to the back end.

This feature was introduced with UI5 1.102.0. The following UI5 versions still contain this feature:

-   1.102.0 to 1.102.5
-   1.103
-   1.104

If you are on one of these releases, we recommend that you upgrade to a higher version where this feature is deactivated.

Deactivated as of:

-   1.106

-   1.105

-   1.102.6


We plan to bring this feature back in a different form at a later point in time.

**Visualization of IANA Time Zones for Date/Time Data** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

**Visualization of IANA Time Zones for Date/Time Data**

SAPUI5 now supports the visualization of IANA time zones for date/time data. The time zone can either be passed via configuration or specified via an annotation from a back-end service.

The following SAPUI5 functionality supports IANA time zones:

-   Configuration of the default time zone via:

    -   The `timezone` configuration option \(see [`sap.ui.core.Configuration`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.Configuration)\).

    -   The API method [`sap.ui.core.Configuration.setTimezone`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.Configuration/methods/setTimezone)

-   The time zone-specific `DateFormat` [`DateTimeWithTimezone`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat.DateTimeWithTimezone), which can be retrieved via [`sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat.getDateTimeWithTimezoneInstance`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/api/sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat%23methods/sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat.getDateTimeWithTimezoneInstance). It allows the formatting/parsing of timestamps while visualizing the date and/or the time and/or the time zone. For more information, see [Date Format](../04_Essentials/date-format-91f2eba.md) and [API Reference: `sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat).
-   The new [`sap.ui.model.odata.type.DateTimeWithTimezone`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.type.DateTimeWithTimezone) composite type where the first part is the time stamp and the second part is the IANA time zone.
-   The OData V4 model supports specifying the time zone via the `com.sap.vocabularies.common.v1.Timezone` annotation. For more information, see:

    -   [Meta Model for OData V4](../04_Essentials/meta-model-for-odata-v4-7f29fb3.md)

    -   [AnnotationHelper](../04_Essentials/meta-model-for-odata-v4-7f29fb3.md#loio7f29fb3ce5964d8090038a9d3cdf5060__section_AnnoHelp)

    In OData V2, this is handled by the enhancements mentioned for `sap.ui.comp.smartfield.SmartField` and `sap.ui.comp.smarttable.SmartTable` below.

-   [`sap.m.DateTimePicker`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.DateTimePicker) visualizes the time zone based on the type information. In addition, it has its own properties for visualizing the time zone.
-   [`sap.ui.comp.smartfield.SmartField`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.comp.smartfield.SmartField) supports time zones for `Edm.DateTimeOffset` fields with the `com.sap.vocabularies.common.v1.Timezone` annotation.
-   [`sap.ui.comp.smarttable.SmartTable`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.comp.smarttable.SmartTable) supports time zones for `Edm.DateTimeOffset` properties with the `com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.TimeZone` annotation. For more information, see the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.comp.smarttable.SmartTable/sample/sap.ui.comp.sample.smarttable).
-   Spreadsheet export now supports the additional `timezone` property. For more information, see [Data Types for Spreadsheet Export](../04_Essentials/data-types-for-spreadsheet-export-283217d.md).
-   SAP Fiori elements: The time zone can be specified for `Edm.DateTimeOffset` fields. For more information, see [Field Help](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/field-help-a5608ea.md).

We have applied the following visual changes, which improve the prioritization of the displayed information on small screen sizes:

-   The title of the `sap.m.NotificationListGroup` doesn’t truncate any more. Instead, it wraps to as many lines it needs.

-   The avatar of the `sap.m.NotificationListItem` is hidden in small \(S\) control size.

-   The action button and the close button \(if present\) are moved to a single overflow in small \(S\) control size.


For more information, see the [NotificationListItem](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.m.NotificationListItem/sample/sap.m.sample.NotificationListItem) and the [NotificationListGroup](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.m.NotificationListGroup/sample/sap.m.sample.NotificationListGroup) samples.

We have improved the usability of the *View Settings* dialog. To do this, we have replaced the `sap.m.Select` control with a `sap.m.ComboBox` control and items of type `sap.m.StandardListItem`.

In particular, the following changes have been applied:

-   We have replaced *None* in the selection lists of the *Sort* and *Group* tabs with the *Sort by* and *Group by* placeholder texts based on the SAP Fiori design guidelines.

-   We have adapted the tooltips of the *Delete* buttons for removing entries on the tabs.

    ![](images/Sort_tab_for_WN_View_Settings_53d93b3.png)

-   For a more simplified search, especially in a long selection list, users can now enter a column name.

**Improved Handling of Aggregations in XML Views** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

**Improved Handling of Aggregations in XML Views**

Aggregations of the XML view itself and of the controls inside the view are now handled in the same way.

If a container control has one of its aggregations marked as the default aggregation, you can now add children directly into that control. For example, if `sap.ui.core.mvc.XMLView`'s `content` aggregation is marked as default, you can define content for the aggregation directly in the XML view, without explicitly adding a `content` tag. Of course, when a container control does not have a default aggregation defined, or when adding a child control into another aggregation, you still need to use an aggregation tag, for example `dependents`.

In order to align the usage of XML views and controls even further, aggregations such as `content` and `dependents` are now also bindable. This is only supported when following the best practice not to use native HTML inside XML views. For more information, see [Aggregation Handling in XML Views](../04_Essentials/aggregation-handling-in-xml-views-19eabf5.md).

The following changes and new features are available for SAP Fiori elements for OData V4:

-   Grouping is now enabled by default in responsive tables. You can disable it using the table personalization in the `manifest.json`. For more information, see [Table Groupings](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/table-groupings-d344c5a.md).

-   We now support the synchronization of data between pages when using the flexible column layout. For more information, see [Enabling the Flexible Column Layout](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/enabling-the-flexible-column-layout-e762257.md).

-   You can now also export a table to PDF. For more information, see [Using the Export Feature](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/using-the-export-feature-4bab6f2.md).

-   We've made additional minor adaptations to the dialog for handling draft changes, for example for navigation, which results in the following UI changes:

    -   We're now showing the following confirmation dialog when a user has created a new object:

        ![](images/ST_DRAFT_DATALOSS_POPUP_MESSAGE_CREATE_c1c8347.png)

        Application developers can use the custom i18n approach to override the corresponding keys \(`ST_DRAFT_DATALOSS_POPUP_MESSAGE_CREATE`\) and \(`ST_DRAFT_DATALOSS_CREATE_ENTITY_TOL`\).

    -   We're now showing the following confirmation dialog when a user has edited an existing object:

        ![](images/ST_DRAFT_DATALOSS_POPUP_MESSAGE_SAVE_c21d563.png)

        Application developers can use the custom i18n approach to override the corresponding keys \(`ST_DRAFT_DATALOSS_POPUP_MESSAGE_SAVE`\) and \(`ST_DRAFT_DATALOSS_SAVE_DRAFT_TOL`\).

-   Applications can now define their own keyboard shortcuts for custom actions. For more information, see [Adding Custom Actions Using Extension Points](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/adding-custom-actions-using-extension-points-7619517.md).

-   The `sap-keep-alive` mode is now available for overview pages. For more information, see [Refresh Entity Sets in sap-keep-alive Mode in the Overview Pages](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/refresh-entity-sets-in-sap-keep-alive-mode-in-the-overview-pages-0c35c87.md).

-   We've enhanced the handling of the draft concept in SAP Fiori elements for OData V2, which results in the following UI changes:

    -   When users edit an object page, we've changed how they switch between the draft and the saved version of a document, to make it more intuitive.

        Until now, when working with the draft version of the document, the user could switch to the saved version using the following button:

        ![](images/Object_page_-_draft_version_of_the_object_is_shown_using_button_text_Display_Saved_Version_6337dc4.png)

        Likewise, when working with the saved version of the document the user could switch to the draft using the following button:

        ![](images/Object_page_-_saved_version_of_the_object_is_shown_using_button_text_Return_to_Draft_8556812.png)

        As of SAPUI5 1.102, when working with the draft version of the document the user can switch to the saved version using the following popover:

        ![](images/Object_page_new_concept_-_draft_version_of_the_object_is_shown_using_button_text_Draft_0971995.png)

        Likewise, when working with the saved version of the document the user can switch to the draft version:

        ![](images/Object_page_new_concept_-_saved_version_of_the_object_is_displayed_746ff83.png)

        The highlighting and labels clearly indicate which version the user is currently working on.

    -   We've changed the dialog for handling draft changes, for example for navigation, to better explain the available options.

        Until now we showed the following confirmation dialog:
