# Localization of UI Texts

If necessary, you can replace standard UI texts for apps that you have created with SAP Fiori elements.

We recommend that you use [SAP Fiori tools](https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/SAP_FIORI_tools/Latest/en-US), which is a set of extensions for SAP Business Application Studio and Visual Studio Code, to build your apps.

Standard texts are available in the generic framework \(for example, the button texts for draft concepts\) and belong to the template components \(for example, list report and object page\). The following sections describe how you replace texts in your generated apps.

When you have created your specific application component, standard texts are available from a specific template component and from the generic template component.

Standard texts can be overwritten by application-specific texts.

Perform the following steps to replace the standard UI texts:

1.  Find or add a resource file to your application.

2.  Search for the text that you would like to change.

3.  Copy the corresponding key and text to your resource file.

4.  Adapt the text as required.


> ### Note:  
> To save translation costs, don't copy and redefine more texts than needed.





### Overriding Texts from Annotations

You can override the texts that come from annotations. To do so, the annotation must refer to the i18n key that is used in the application’s i18n file:

> ### Sample Code:  
> XML Annotation
> 
> ```
> <Annotation Term="UI.LineItem">
>    <Collection>
>       <Record Type="UI.DataFieldForAction">
>          <PropertyValue Property="Label" String="Add random item"/>
>          <PropertyValue Property="Action"
>             String="com.c_salesordermanage_sd.AddRandomItem"/>
>       </Record>
>       <Record Type="UI.DataFieldForAction">
>          <PropertyValue Property="Label" String="{@i18n>CopyActionText}"/>
>          <PropertyValue Property="Action"
>             String="com.c_salesordermanage_sd.CopyItem"/>
>       </Record>
>    </Collection>
> </Annotation>
> 
> ```

> ### Sample Code:  
> ABAP CDS Annotation
> 
> ```
> @UI.lineItem: [
>   {
>     label: 'Add random item',
>     dataAction: 'PUSHDOWN:com.c_salesordermanage_sd.AddRandomItem',
>     type: #FOR_ACTION,
>     position: 1 
>   },
>   {
>     label: '{@i18n>CopyActionText}',
>     dataAction: 'PUSHDOWN:com.c_salesordermanage_sd.CopyItem',
>     type: #FOR_ACTION,
>     position: 2 
>   }
> ];
> 
> ```

> ### Sample Code:  
> CAP CDS Annotation
> 
> ```
> LineItem                               : [
>     {
>         $Type  : 'UI.DataFieldForAction',
>         Label  : 'Add random item',
>         Action : 'com.c_salesordermanage_sd.AddRandomItem'
>     },
>     {
>         $Type  : 'UI.DataFieldForAction',
>         Label  : '{@i18n>CopyActionText}',       //i18n key referred here
>         Action : 'com.c_salesordermanage_sd.CopyItem'
>     },
>     .
>     .
>     .
> ]
> ```

For the annotation example above, the application’s i18n properties file must have the key `CopyActionText=Copy Selected Item`. In addition, the model should have the `@i18n` model defined within the manifest file.

> ### Sample Code:  
> `manifest.json`
> 
> ```
>  "models": {
>                …
>                …
>                "@i18n": {
>                               "type": "sap.ui.model.resource.ResourceModel",
>               "uri": "i18n/i18n.properties"
>                },
>                …
>                …
> }
> 
> ```

> ### Note:  
> The annotation modification described above is done in a local annotations file if the back-end generated file does not have the corresponding annotation segment.
> 
> For example, if the back-end system is based on SAP NetWeaver 7.51 or lower \(SAP S/4HANA\) or on SAP NetWeaver 7.67 or lower \(SAP S/4HANA Cloud\), you can't add `UI.ReferenceFacet` via the back end. In such a case, a modification to the *Reference Facet* label is only possible by modifying the local annotation file as described above.

## Additional Features in SAP Fiori Elements for OData V2

When you have created your specific application component, for example in SAP Web IDE or in SAP Fiori tools, standard texts are available from a specific template component \(for example, i18n file within `sap.suite.ui.generic.template.ListReport`\) and from the generic template component \(for example, i18n file within `sap.suite.ui.generic.template.lib`\).

Texts from the *Generic Application Component* can't be replaced.

Applications can choose to override any key that are mentioned in the following table. You can do so by using the custom i18n file approach.

Any references to SAP Web IDE in this documentation are only relevant for you if you have access to SAP Web IDE through a productive SAP BTP account. Please consider SAP Business Application Studio as an alternative. See [App Development Using SAP Business Application Studio](../05_Developing_Apps/app-development-using-sap-business-application-studio-6bbad66.md).

For more information about SAP Web IDE, see the documentation for SAP Web IDE on the SAP Help Portal at [https://help.sap.com/viewer/p/SAP\_Web\_IDE](https://help.sap.com/viewer/p/SAP_Web_IDE).



### How to Find the Resource File of Your Application Component

SAP Web IDE automatically generates the following folders and files when you create an app with SAP Fiori elements:

-   <root-folder\>

-   |—i18n

-   |—<shortened template component name\>, for example, List Report and Object Page

-   |—<entitySet\>

-   |—i18n.properties

    > ### Note:  
    > This file contains instructions on how to find the standard UI texts for your application. You need them for the step *How to Replace the Standard UI Texts with Application-Specific Texts* in this topic.


The folder path to the resource model appears as shown below. Since the `manifest.json` file also refers to the title and description of the app, there is a general `i18n.properties` file on the top level:

-   `i18n.properties`
-   `i18n/ListReport/<entitySet>/POHeaders/i18n.properties`
-   `i18n/ObjectPage/<entitySet>/i18n.properties`
-   `i18n/ObjectPage/<subEntitySet>/i18n.properties`

    > ### Note:  
    > For object pages, the number of i18n files corresponds to the number of object pages defined in the app.


The app descriptor \(`manifest.json` file\) of an application specifies the SAPUI5 models.

Example:

```
"sap.ui5": {
 
        ...
    "models": {
        "i18n": {                
            "type": "sap.ui.model.resource.ResourceModel",                
            "uri": "i18n/i18n.properties"           
      },
 
        "i18n|sap.suite.ui.generic.template.ListReport|POHeaders": {
            "type": "sap.ui.model.resource.ResourceModel",
            "uri": "i18n/ListReport/POHeaders/i18n.properties"
              },
        "i18n|sap.suite.ui.generic.template.ObjectPage|POHeaders": {
                    "type": "sap.ui.model.resource.ResourceModel",
                    "uri": "i18n/ObjectPage/POHeaders/i18n.properties"
              },
        "i18n|sap.suite.ui.generic.template.ObjectPage|POItems": {
                    "type": "sap.ui.model.resource.ResourceModel",
                    "uri": "i18n/ObjectPage/POItems/i18n.properties"

```

The URL reflects the folder path to the resource model. The model's name, `i18n|sap.suite.ui.generic.template.ObjectPage|POHeaders`, is separated by lines used to identify the specific template component and entity set for which the resource model can be enhanced by editing the `i18n.properties` file.



### How to Replace the Standard UI Texts with Application-Specific Texts

To replace the standard UI texts, perform the following steps:

1.  Go to the final block of the standard UI texts that starts as follows: `#---Final block: texts to be redefined by the application -------`

2.  Copy this block to the corresponding i18n property file of your app under `webapp/i18n`.

    Consider the detailed instructions that you find as comments in the original property file: For example, a text might be relevant only for the root object, or it might also be relevant for detail pages of subitems. In the latter case, if you have defined multiple object pages in your app, you have to copy and adapt each of them.

3.  After copying the blocks to the relevant files, adjust the texts as described in the comment. For example, replace the generic text *object* by your entity type name.




<a name="loiob8cb649973534f08a6047692f8c6830d__section_qty_nb1_zlb"/>

## Additional Features in SAP Fiori Elements for OData V4

When you have created your specific application component, standard UI texts are available from a specific template component \(`sap.fe.templates`\) and from the generic template component.

> ### Tip:  
> You can also use the building blocks provided by SAP Fiori elements in applications built without using one of our floorplans. If none of our floorplans suit your use case, you can build a custom app that still runs on the SAP Fiori elements framework, but where all pages are treated like custom pages. For more information about how to override the standard UI texts when you're using building blocks, see [Adapt i18n](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/fe/core/fpmExplorer/index.html#/buildingBlocks/guidance/adaptI18n).

Applications can currently choose to override any key from the list below. Check the last column in the following table for a recommendation about which default texts to override. Only the keys given in the table are allowed to be overridden by application developers using the custom i18n file approach:

### Adding a New Resource in the Properties File

Provide the new custom texts in this custom resource bundle with the same key as the one used by SAP Fiori elements \(from the allowed list provided above\). For example:

> ### Example:  
> -   SAP Fiori elements default values \(resource bundle of SAP Fiori elements\):
> 
>     `C_OPERATIONS_ACTION_CONFIRM_MESSAGE=Do you really want to perform this action?`
> 
>     `C_TRANSACTION_HELPER_OBJECT_PAGE_CONFIRM_DELETE_WITH_OBJECTTITLE_PLURAL=Delete the selected objects?`
> 
>     `C_TRANSACTION_HELPER_OBJECT_PAGE_CONFIRM_DELETE_WITH_OBJECTTITLE_SINGULAR=Delete this object?`
> 
> -   Text values from `i18n/customSalesOrderLR.properties` \(custom resource bundle of the application\):
> 
>     `C_OPERATIONS_ACTION_CONFIRM_MESSAGE|SalesOrderManage|ReturnInProcess=Can you please confirm if you really want to trigger the returns?`
> 
>     `C_TRANSACTION_HELPER_OBJECT_PAGE_CONFIRM_DELETE_WITH_OBJECTTITLE_PLURAL|SalesOrderManage=Do you want to delete the selected Sales Orders?`
> 
>     `C_TRANSACTION_HELPER_OBJECT_PAGE_CONFIRM_DELETE_WITH_OBJECTTITLE_SINGULAR|SalesOrderManage=Do you want to delete this Sales Order?`
> 
>     Since the application has defined new texts for the above-mentioned resources, while triggering the confirmation action *Returns in Process*, we see the custom text: "Can you please confirm if you really want to trigger the returns?" instead of "Are you sure that you want to execute this action?" in the action parameter popup.



### Manifest Changes

Changes must be made in the manifest file of the application. Add `enhanceI18n` to the `settings` of the corresponding section as shown in the following code sample:

> ### Sample Code:  
> ```json
> {
>    ...
>    ...
>    "targets": {
>     "SalesOrderManageList": {
>         "type": "Component",
>         "id": "SalesOrderManageList",
>         "name": "sap.fe.templates.ListReport",
>         "options": {
>             "settings": {
>                 "entitySet": "SalesOrderManage",
>                 "enhanceI18n": "i18n/customSalesOrderLR.properties", // This is the line to be added - it provides Fiori Elements with the name of the custom resource bundle
>                 ...
>                 ...
>                 ...
>             }
>         }
>     }
>    }
>    ...
>    ...
> }
> ```



### Format of Custom Keys

For resources that are not shared across multiple entities or by multiple controls \(for example, you want the same OK text in all OK confirmation popovers\), don't append anything to the existing key.

> ### Example:  
> `C_COMMON_DIALOG_OK=OK?` \(resource bundle of SAP Fiori elements\)
> 
> `C_COMMON_DIALOG_OK=Okie?` \(custom resource bundle of the application\)

For resources that are shared across multiple entity sets, append the navigation property name \(for navigation entity sets\) or the entity set name \(in case of main entity\). For instance, you want different delete messages based on the entity being deleted.

> ### Example:  
> `C_TRANSACTION_HELPER_OBJECT_PAGE_CONFIRM_DELETE_WITH_OBJECTTITLE_SINGULAR=Delete this object?` \(resource bundle of SAP Fiori elements\)
> 
> `C_TRANSACTION_HELPER_OBJECT_PAGE_CONFIRM_DELETE_WITH_OBJECTTITLE_SINGULAR|_Items=Do you want to delete this Sales Order Item?` 

For overriding actions that have parameters, some of the text in the action parameter popovers can be overridden. Confirmation actions also get a confirmation popover that has text that can be overridden. To override these texts, the action name along with the entity set name \(or the navigation property name in case of navigation entity set\) has to be provided. This is a mandatory piece of information, even if the application needs the custom text for an action that is used in only 1 entity set. If the entity set name is not appended, the resource bundle text from SAP Fiori elements is used as a fallback.

> ### Example:  
> `C_OPERATIONS_ACTION_CONFIRM_MESSAGE=Are you sure that you want to execute this action?`
> 
> \(resource bundle of SAP Fiori elements - this text is shown for all confirmation actions, irrespective of the action name or the entity\)
> 
> `C_OPERATIONS_ACTION_CONFIRM_MESSAGE|SalesOrderManage|ReturnInProcess=Can you please confirm if you really want to trigger the returns?`

In the above example, the developer wants to show the custom message only when a user clicks the `ReturnsInProcess` action of the `SalesOrderManage` entity set. For a second action in the same entity set the last part of the key is different, since the action name is different.

If the action name is the same but the entity differs, then the second part of the key name above is different and SAP Fiori elements uses the correct key based on the entity set to which the clicked action is associated.

> ### Example:  
> `C_OPERATIONS_ACTION_CONFIRM_MESSAGE|_Items|ReturnInProcess=Can you please confirm if you really want to trigger the returns for the chosen items?`
