-   `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataContextBinding#hasPendingChanges`,
-   `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel#hasPendingChanges`;

-   `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataContextBinding#resetChanges`,
-   `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel#resetChanges`.

You can prevent the activation of inactive rows after user input since SAPUI5 1.109 using `sap.ui.base.Event#preventDefault` in the handler of the `createActivate` event.

**Dates, Times, Timestamps, and Time Zones**

The new version of SAPUI5 introduces the following features for time zone configuration:

-   We provide `sap.ui.core.date.UI5Date`. It inherits from the JavaScript `Date` and works in a similar way, but uses the time zone provided via the `sap-timezone` URL parameter instead of the local time zone of the browser. The `UI5Date.getInstance` factory method returns a `UI5Date` instance if a time zone different from the local time zone of the browser was provided to SAPUI5; otherwise, it returns a JavaScript `Date`.

    For more information, see [Dates, Times, Timestamps, and Time Zones](../04_Essentials/dates-times-timestamps-and-time-zones-6c9e61d.md).

-   `DateFormat` and UI5 types in `sap.ui.model.odata.type` now use `UI5Date`, and any methods previously returning a JavaScript `Date` now return a `UI5Date` if a time zone different from the local time zone of the browser was provided.
-   The `DynamicDateRange` control now provides the `toDates` static public method that replaces `DynamicDateUtil`'s existing `toDates` method and returns either `UI5Date`s or native JavaScript `Date`s.
-   We have adapted the following controls to use `UI5Date` instead of JavaScript's native `Date`:
    -   `sap.m.DatePicker`,
    -   `sap.m.TimePicker`,
    -   `sap.m.DateTimePicker`,
    -   `sap.m.DateRangeSelection`,
    -   `sap.ui.unified.Calendar`.

-   We provide the `getModelValue` method for

    -   `sap.ui.model.odata.type.Date`,
    -   `sap.ui.model.odata.type.DateTime`,
    -   `sap.ui.model.odata.type.DateTimeOffset`,
    -   `sap.ui.model.odata.type.Time`,
    -   `sap.ui.model.odata.type.TimeOfDay`.

    It returns the model representation of the provided `UI5Date` or `Date`.

**Changed Format of What's New Content**

We have introduced a new channel for our What's New content: You can now view the content in the What's New viewer as well. The What's New viewer allows you to display and search for entries across all versions. For each entry, various attributes are displayed, for example, the type of change and whether it is related to a feature or a control.

We have also changed the format of the What's New content in the Demo Kit. You can show or hide the columns for these attributes. Similar to the What's New viewer, you can filter the entries based on these attributes by clicking on *Filter* or simply based on a search term.
