**Test Recorder**

The Test Recorder tool is now part of the SAPUI5 framework and is available in all browsers. Use it in any SAPUI5 app to inspect the rendered user interface, view the control properties, and get hints about writing tests. The tool is aligned with the two official SAPUI5 testing tools – OPA5 and UIVeri5.

**Navigation in Nested Components**

In recent releases, the capabilities to [Navigate with Nested Components](../04_Essentials/navigate-with-nested-components-8e9d6e4.md) were enhanced significantly. In addition to the available documentation, a [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.core.routing.Router/sample/sap.ui.core.sample.RoutingNestedComponent) has been added to showcase some fundamental possibilities of using components to structure applications and how to interconnect them via routing.

**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model**

The new version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model introduces the following features:

-   The `autoExpandSelect:true` model setting has been enhanced for property bindings that are added later.

-   We have added the `sap.ui.model.v4.ODataListBinding.getDownloadUrl` method.
-   `sap.ui.model.v4.AnnotationHelper.format` can now be used for operation parameters.
-   For messages returned in error responses of operation calls, targets pointing to operation parameters are now parsed correctly.
-   The `sap.ui.model.v4.Context.setProperty` method can be used to set properties locally on the client by specifying `null` as the `groupId`. The set value is then not included in PATCH and POST requests to create the new entity.
-   Annotation targets for \(overloaded\) bound operations in 4.01 Format are also supported in value list metadata.

> ### Restriction:  
> Due to the limited feature scope of this version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, check that all required features are in place before developing applications. Double-check the detailed documentation of the features, as certain parts of a feature may be missing. While we aim to be compatible with existing controls, some controls might not work due to small incompatibilities compared to `sap.ui.model.odata.(v2.)ODataModel`, or due to missing features in the model \(such as tree binding\). This also applies to smart controls \(`sap.ui.comp` library\) that do not support the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, as well as controls such as `TreeTable` and `AnalyticalTable`, which are not supported in combination with the SAPUI5 OData V4 model. The interface for applications has been changed for easier and more efficient use of the model. For a summary of these changes, see [Changes Compared to OData V2 Model](../04_Essentials/changes-compared-to-odata-v2-model-abd4d7c.md).

For more information, see [OData V4 Model](../04_Essentials/odata-v4-model-5de13cf.md), the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4), and the [Samples](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel) in the Demo Kit.

**`sap.ui.integration.widgets.Card`**

-   A new experimental Calendar Card type is now available . Its purpose is to give an overview of a single entity \(a person, for example\). It consists of an interactive calendar, legend, and a schedule. For more information, see [Calendar Card](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/types/calendar) in the Card Explorer.
-   We have enabled Data Sources to be used in the descriptor for `sap.ui.integration.widgets.Card`. Data Sources are named and reusable manifest entities that hold configuration settings for services. Referenced using special double-bracketed syntax, they are used to construct data request URLs. Data Sources are defined in the `sap.app` part of the manifest. For more information, see [Data Sources](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/features/dataSources) in the Card Explorer.
-   We have introduced new number formatters to represent the data on the UI in human-readable format. Now we have predefined number formatters for:

    -   Currency
    -   Date and Time
    -   Floating-point numbers
    -   Integers
    -   Percent
    -   Units of measurement

    For more information, see [Card Formatters](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/formatters) in the Card Explorer.

-   We now also support objects as values for manifest parameters. Until now only string values were supported. For more information, see [Manifest Parameters](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/features/manifestParameters) section in the Card Explorer.
-   We have introduced a new experimental type of card - Adaptive Card. With this type of card, you can visualize and reuse cards created using the Microsoft Adaptive Cards specification and manifest, while achieving fully adapted SAP Fiori 3 user experience, out of the box. For more information, see [Adaptive Card](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/types/adaptive) in the Card Explorer.

**List Report and Object Page**

-   **Smart Multi-Input Control in Smart Tables** 

    It is now possible to include a smart multi-input field in a smart table on an object page. For more information, see [Using the Multi-Input Field on the Object Page](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/using-the-multi-input-field-on-the-object-page-04ff5b1.md).

-   **Flexible Column Layout: Displayed Item on Object Page Highlighted in Master List**

    The navigation row in the table is highlighted in blue to correlate with the object being displayed in applications with flexible column layout.

-   **Object Page Saves and Restores State of Control Variants**

    This means that the selected table variants are stored in the same way as the control variants for the list report page.

-   **Configuration of Relevant Links**

    SAP Fiori Elements now gives you the option of configuring relevant links in Related Apps. For more information, see [Enabling the Related Apps Button](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/enabling-the-related-apps-button-8dcfe2e.md).

-   **Option to Set Initial Expansion Level in List Report and Analytical List Page Tables**

    You can now set `initialExpansionLevel` using the `PresentationVariant` annotation to set the number of expanded levels for tables and trees. For more information, see [Initial Expansion Level for Tables in List Reports & Analytical List Pages](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/initial-expansion-level-for-tables-in-list-reports-analytical-list-pages-bc05d35.md).

-   **Themes**

    SAP Quartz Light is now available by default for applications that are generated by the SAP Web IDE wizard and plugin.
