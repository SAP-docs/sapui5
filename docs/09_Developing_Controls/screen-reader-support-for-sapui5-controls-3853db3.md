Screen readers offer list features, that ease the app navigation, by grouping and extracting all elements with similar behaviors. This leads to additional requirements when creating SAPUI5 controls. Control developers need to make sure that their controls are marked with the correct ARIA role.

Tooltips and semantic colors are important aspects in apps. They have to be interpreted correctly by the screen reader and require some special ARIA labeling.
