# Step 10: Automated Testing

In this step, we will step back from our tests and application features that we have implemented so far and take a closer look at another important piece of the test setup - the test automation. We will learn how to set up a basic test automation, which might be used in a continuous integration system or locally to run tests via shell.



## Automated Testing

Please, follow the steps described in [Test Automation](../04_Essentials/test-automation-ae44824.md#loioae448243822448d8ba04b4784f4b09a0) to configure an automated test setup.

The test runner can be included in your project setup so that it is called whenever code changes are submitted.")
