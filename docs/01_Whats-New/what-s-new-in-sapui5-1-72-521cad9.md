****Responsive Paddings Enablement****

We have introduced the `sap.ui.core.util.ResponsivePaddingsEnablement` utility for applying responsive paddings over separate parts of the controls, when using the SAP Quartz themes. The breakpoints and layout paddings can now be determined by the container's width, and not by the screen size. We have introduced responsive paddings to the `sap.m.Page`,`sap.m.Popover`, and `sap.m.Wizard` controls.

For more information, see [Enabling Responsive Paddings According to the Control Width](../04_Essentials/enabling-responsive-paddings-according-to-the-control-width-3b718b5.md).

**Navigation in Nested Components**

The navigation in nested components has been enhanced with additional information that can now be passed in optional parameters of the `navTo` method of `sap.ui.core.routing.Router`. This additional information enables the routers in nested components to show the targets which are configured to one specific route.

For more information, see [`sap.ui.core.routing.Router.navTo`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.routing.Router/methods/navTo) in the API Reference and [Navigate with Nested Components](../04_Essentials/navigate-with-nested-components-8e9d6e4.md).

**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model**

The new version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model introduces the following features:

-   Server-driven paging is now supported unless the server-driven paging takes place in a collection requested with `$expand`.

-   The `resetChanges` method on bindings returns a promise which is resolved without a defined result as soon as all changes in the binding itself and all dependent bindings are canceled.


> ### Restriction:  
> Due to the limited feature scope of this version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, check that all required features are in place before developing freestyle and SAP Fiori elements applications. Double-check the detailed documentation of the features, as certain parts of a feature may be missing. While we aim to be compatible with existing controls, some controls might not work due to small incompatibilities compared to `sap.ui.model.odata.(v2.)ODataModel`, or due to missing features in the model \(such as tree binding\). This also applies to smart controls \(`sap.ui.comp` library\) that do not support the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, as well as controls such as `TreeTable` and `AnalyticalTable`, which are not supported in combination with the SAPUI5 OData V4 model. The interface for applications has been changed for easier and more efficient use of the model. For a summary of these changes, see [Changes Compared to OData V2 Model](../04_Essentials/changes-compared-to-odata-v2-model-abd4d7c.md).

For more information, see [OData V4 Model](../04_Essentials/odata-v4-model-5de13cf.md), the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4), and the [Samples](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel).

**`sap.f.FlexibleColumnLayoutSemanticHelper`**

Some methods in the helper class rely on the internal `sap.f.FlexibleColumnLayout` reference to be rendered. To facilitate their use, we have implemented two new public methods: `whenDOMReady` and `isDOMReady`. Additionally, two more abstract methods were implemented that internally wrap `isDOMReady` and `whenDOMReady`, which provide means for other similar methods to be combined, if necessary.For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.f.FlexibleColumnLayoutSemanticHelper).

-   A new parameter for the direction of the `swipe` event is now available for both left-to-right \(LTR\) and right-to-left \(RTL\) scenarios. This parameter can be used in an app for approvals, for example, where a manager wants to accept or reject leave requests using the swipe function on a mobile device or touch screen. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.SwipeDirection) for `SwipeDirection`, the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.ListBase/events/swipe) for `swipe`, and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.m.List/sample/sap.m.sample.ListSwipe).

-   A new `navigated` property is now available: After a user has displayed the details of an item, a navigation indicator at the end of the corresponding row indicates that the user has already viewed the details. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.ListItemBase), the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.m.StandardListItem) for lists, and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.m.Table) for tables.

-   For built-in tabs \(Sort, Group, and Filter\), the initial state of the Sort and Group settings is stored upon first opening. If changed, this state can be restored later using the *Reset* button and Filter tab selection is removed. If no changes have been made, the *Reset* button remains inactive.
-   For custom tabs \(or custom and built-in tabs together\), developers can use the `Reset` event. The *Reset* button is in an active state, no matter if changes are made or not.

SAP Fiori elements now provides keyboard shortcuts for basic operations. For more information, see [Keyboard Shortcuts](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/keyboard-shortcuts-0cd318c.md).

**List Report and Object Page**

The object page has the following new features:

-   Messages in the message popover are now grouped according to the respective sections.

-   When creating and saving non-draft records, users stay on the object page by default. To allow users to navigate directly back to the list report, you can set the `navToListOnSave` flag to `true` in the `manifest.json`. For more information, see [Save and Navigation Options on the Object Page](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/save-and-navigation-options-on-the-object-page-55d81bc.md).

-   When a user navigates to the object page in display mode, the focus is now on the first emphasized action button. In create mode, the focus is now on the first editable element.


**Analytical List Page**

`Edm.String` and `sap:semantics="yearmonth"` as well as `Edm.String` and `sap:semantics="year"` are now supported in the visual filter in date-based, single selection fields in the Universal Time Coordinated \(UTC\) format.
