# Creating Cards for the Insights Cards Section of **My Home** in SAP S/4HANA Cloud and **My Home** in SAP S/4HANA

An option for tables in the list report or charts in the analytical list page allows end users to create cards that can be added to the *Insights* section of **My Home** in SAP S/4HANA Cloud and **My Home** in SAP S/4HANA.

**Prerequisites**

You must enable **My Home** in SAP S/4HANA Cloud and **My Home** in SAP S/4HANA to create and add cards.

Once you've enabled **My Home** in SAP S/4HANA Cloud and **My Home** in SAP S/4HANA, the *Add Card to Insights* option automatically appears in the overflow toolbar of the table in list report applications and the overflow toolbar of the chart in analytical list page applications.

> ### Note:  
> The card creation dialog shows only those columns that are supported for a card. The card supports single-valued `DataField` based columns. It also supports columns with field values displayed as links such as `DataFieldWithUrl`, semantic links, and `DataField` with `QuickViewFacets`. In addition, SAP Fiori elements for OData V4 also supports `DataFieldWithIntentBasedNavigation` and `DataFieldWithNavigationPath` columns.
> 
> The columns that are not supported by the card creation dialog include:
> 
> -   Image
> 
> -   Multi-valued based columns
> 
> -   `FieldGroup` based columns
> 
> -   Columns with inline action
> 
> -   Columns with navigation button
> 
> -   `DataFieldForAnnotation` based columns \(for contact or address fields\)
> 
> -   Custom columns

You can switch off the option to add cards to the *Insights Cards* section of **My Home** using the manifest setting.

## Additional Features in SAP Fiori Elements for OData V2

Using the `manifest.json`, list report applications can choose to hide this feature by setting the `addCardtoInsightsHidden` property within `tableSettings` to `true`, as displayed in the following sample code:

> ### Sample Code:  
> ```
> "sap.ui.generic.app": {
>     "pages": [{
>         "entitySet": "Zfarvd_Bs_Hd_Bo",
>         "component": {
>             "name": "sap.suite.ui.generic.template.ListReport",
>             "list": true,
>             "settings": {
>                 "tableSettings": { 
>                     "addCardtoInsightsHidden": "true" //default value false
>                 }
>             }
>         }
>     }]
> }
> ```

Similarly, using the `manifest.json`, analytical list page applications can choose to hide this feature by setting the `addCardtoInsightsHidden` property within `chartSettings` to `true`, as displayed in the following sample code:

> ### Sample Code:  
> ```
> "sap.ui.generic.app": {
>     "pages": [{
>         "entitySet": "Zfarvd_Bs_Hd_Bo",
>         "component": {
>             "name": "sap.suite.ui.generic.template.AnalyticalListPage",
>             "list": true,
>             "settings": {
>                 "chartSettings": { 
>                     "addCardtoInsightsHidden": "true" //default value false
>                 }
>             }
>         }
>     }]
> }
> ```
