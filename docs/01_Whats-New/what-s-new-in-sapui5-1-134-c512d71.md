**`sap.ui.mdc.Table`**

Up to now, the `p13n` data and the variants did not save the information about whether details are displayed or hidden in a table \(*Show More per Row*/*Show Less per Row* buttons\). The state of this data is now persisted for responsive tables when the user presses the *Show More per Row* or the *Show Less per Row* button, when a new column is added or a variant is changed, or via `sap.ui.mdc.p13n.StateUtil`. Depending on what happens in the scenario, the state gets updated or stays the same, for example, for a new column that is hidden in the popin, `showDetails` is set to `true` and a change is created or, if it isn't hidden, the state stays the same.

In alignment with OData V4, the `SmartFilterBar` control now ensures that multiple pasted values adhere to the maximum length defined in the metadata, preventing back-end errors caused by excessive input. This feature is useful for maintaining data integrity and avoiding errors when users paste data into filter fields. For more information, see the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.comp.smartfilterbar.SmartFilterBar/sample/sap.ui.comp.sample.smartfilterbar.Basic).

We've improved accessibility by removing default labels for untitled subsections and sections in the `ObjectPageLayout` control. This change ensures a cleaner and more intuitive navigation experience, as labeling now occurs at the section level or is derived from the anchor bar, improving usability for screen-reader users.

**SAP Fiori Elements for OData V4**

The following changes and new features are available for SAP Fiori elements for OData V4:

-   We've simplified draft handling in applications that only contain a very limited number of editable fields by hiding all features related to draft handling from the UI. For more information, see [Draft Handling](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/draft-handling-ed9aa41.md).

-   Side effects can now be triggered by custom fields in forms or custom table columns. For more information, see [Side Effects](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/side-effects-18b17bd.md).

-   Key users can now configure features that require modifications in the`manifest.json` file. This option is also available for legacy applications that use an array structure in the `manifest.json` file. For more information, see [Adapting the UI](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/adapting-the-ui-59bfd31.md).

-   We’ve added the *Share to SAP Collaboration Manager* option to the context menu of tables.

We have removed from the display of the date ranges in the *Select* dropdown *Unit of Time* in cases when it has become redundant because only one unit of time \(for example *Last X Minutes*\) has been specified by the application developer.

Based on user testing feedback, we have implemented several improvements:

-   The clock dial in 24-hour format is now reprogrammed as a single circular interface.
-   Hovering over a number or a dot in the clock dial now highlights and visualizes the number for the respective hour.
-   Dots in the clock dial are now selectable.
-   To enhance visual interaction, we have improved animations for transitions between different clock dial visualization states \(hours, minutes, seconds\).

The new Overlay Mode allows `SideNavigation` to reside in `sap.m.ResponsivePopover` and function as a standard `SideNavigation`. To activate Overlay Mode, set the `verticalScrolling` property of the `ResponsivePopover` to `false`. In addition, we have created a new `design` property in `SideNavigation`. The `design` property handles the control’s container styling and we strongly recommend setting it to `Plain` in Overlay Mode. For more information, see the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.tnt.SideNavigation/sample/sap.tnt.sample.SideNavigationOverlayMode).

The new `gap` property offers a simple and consistent approach to defining space between flex items \(rows and columns\), ensuring visual separation and enhancing the layout structure. Additionally, the `rowGap` and `columnGap` longhand properties can be used for more precision and take precedence over `gap` if both `gap` and either `rowGap` or `columnGap` are specified. For more information, see the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.m.FlexBox/sample/sap.m.sample.FlexBoxGap).

We've introduced the `uploadProgress` and the `uploadTerminated` events in the `sap.m.upload.UploadItem` element within the `sap.m.plugins.UploadSetwithTable` plugin. The `uploadProgress` event provides the progress details of a file upload. The `uploadTerminated` event notifies if a file upload has been terminated.

We’ve also introduced the `terminateUpload` public API to terminate an ongoing file upload. When users terminate a file upload using the `terminateUpload` API, the termination is confirmed and notified through the `uploadTerminated` event.

For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.upload.UploadItem) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.m.plugins.UploadSetwithTable/sample/sap.m.sample.UploadSetwithTablePlugin.ResponsiveTableProgressIndicator).
