# Using a Custom Root View

The root view is the view that is loaded when the application is started. For more information, see [App Overview: The Basic Files of Your App](../05_Developing_Apps/app-overview-the-basic-files-of-your-app-28b59ca.md).

If the standard root views `NavContainer` or `FlexibleColumnLayout` don't fit your requirements, you can create and register a custom root view.

For more information and live examples, see the SAP Fiori Development Portal at [Custom Page - Custom Root View](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/fe/core/fpmExplorer/index.html#/buildingBlocks/guidance/guidanceOwnRootView).
