# The `Chart` Building Block

The `Chart` building block provides an easy way to instantiate a chart based on an `entitySet` or a specific navigation property.

## Usage

Ensure that the entity set referred for the `Chart` building block supports aggregation. For more information, see the subsection *Enabling Aggregation in the Back End* in [Configuring Charts](configuring-charts-653ed0f.md).

> ### Sample Code:  
> `Chart` Building Block
> 
> ```
> <macros:Chart
>     id="chartDefault"
>     contextPath="/RootEntitySet"
>     metaPath="@com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.Chart"
>     dataPointsSelected=".onChartSelectionChanged"
>     personalization="Sort,Type,Item"
>     selectionMode="Multiple"
> ></macros:Chart>
> ```

Applications can do the following with the chart building block:

-   Link chart building block with the filter building block.

-   Enable chart building block for variant management.

-   Add custom actions.

-   Configure the chart title and control header visibility.

-   Control the visibility of tabs within the chart personalization options.

-   Get and set the presentation variants associated with the chart building block using the public APIs: `getPresentationVariant()` and `setPresentationVariant()`.

    Get and set the selection variants associated with the chart building block using the public APIs: `getSelectionVariant()` and `setSelectionVariant()`.

    > ### Note:  
    > The get and set selection variant methods only work if the chart personalization is enabled. For more information, see [Enabling Table Personalization](enabling-table-personalization-3e2b4d2.md).

-   Get and set the currently visible variant ID.
