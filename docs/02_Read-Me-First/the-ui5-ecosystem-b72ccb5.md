## UI5 Tooling



UI5 Tooling is a state-of-the-art way to develop SAPUI5 projects by consuming SAPUI5 via npm. It's an open-source, modular, configurable, and extensible CLI for efficient development of applications, libraries, and reuse components with the SAPUI5 framework. Here's what you get with this build and development tooling:

-   Reuse of open source tooling
-   Flexibility and extensibility
-   Easy integration
-   Enablement of modern language features
-   Support for any IDE of your choice

## UI5 Linter



UI5 linter is a static code analysis tool for SAPUI5 projects. It checks JavaScript, TypeScript, XML, JSON, and other files in your project and reports findings.

UI5 linter scans your SAPUI5 project and detects issues that can prevent the project from running smoothly with SAPUI5 2.x.

-   Usage of deprecated SAPUI5 libraries
-   Usage of deprecated SAPUI5 framework APIs
-   Usage of global variables
-   Possible CSP violations
-   Deprecated component and manifest configurations
-   and many more

## Easy-UI5 Generator



Easy-UI5 is an open-source Yeoman generator that should be used by everybody working with CLI tools to create simpleSAPUI5-based web-apps and other SAPUI5-related projects within seconds.

This generator has been created to simplify the creation of SAPUI5 prototypes. Now you can scaffold simple SAPUI5 projects from the shell/terminal of your choice. The current best practices \(such as async\) are already baked into our templates so you don't have to worry about the definition of the metadata files.

The purpose of this generator is to guide you through your first steps with SAPUI5 and SAP BTP deployments. Once you’re familiar with those technologies, you might want to tweak the projects to adapt them for productive use cases \(such as continuous deployment pipelines and full i18n\).

## UI5-TypeScript



TypeScript is an extension of JavaScript that adds type information to the language. It helps developers catch errors early through type checking and by providing code assist in many supporting code editors \(for example, through code completion and inline documentation\). Browsers can’t execute TypeScript directly, it needs to be transpiled to JavaScript, which can then be executed as usual.

For SAPUI5, we have published definition files that contain type definitions describing the SAPUI5 APIs and types. With the help of these definitions, you can write SAPUI5 apps in TypeScript and enjoy all the benefits that come with it.
