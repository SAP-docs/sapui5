# Best Practices for Developers

This page is a good starting point for you to ensure your code bases, specifically your SAPUI5 applications and libraries, are ready for the future and won't become outdated.



<a name="loio28fcd55b04654977b63dacbee0552712__section_kg5_3nj_rzb"/>

## Alignment for Future-Proof Code

The SAPUI5 framework is always evolving to benefit from newer features in web browsers \(like ECMAScript support\) or to account for their end of maintenance \(like the end of IE11 support\). This is a continuous journey towards future major framework versions and improvements.

Therefore, it's important that you keep applying best practices. To help you, we frequently update the documentation in many places. This page collects fundamental information and offers practical guidance, and it will continue to evolve over time.

## Best Practices for Legacy-Free Code

> ### Note:  
> The following information is a preliminary yet practical collection of best practices to ensure legacy-free SAPUI5 development. We're continuously improving it to reflect our latest recommendations. It will be further enhanced to both help transform existing code bases and provide guidance for creating new code.



### Supporting Tool - UI5 Linter

[UI5 linter](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-linter) is a command-line tool to identify legacy code in your SAPUI5 project. It checks JavaScript, TypeScript, XML, JSON, and other files in your project and reports findings if legacy code is used. UI5 linter is our state-of-the-art tool to get and keep your SAPUI5 project legacy-free.



### Goals

The main objectives when migrating existing code or keeping it up to date with framework best practices are:

-   **No sync loading of code**

    This is for compliance with our Content Security Policy. For more information, see [Make Your App CSP Compliant](make-your-app-csp-compliant-1f81a09.md).

-   **No sync loading of data**

    This helps avoid deprecation warnings of web browsers regarding sync XHR.

-   **No use of global names**

    This helps avoid pollution of the global namespace and conflicts with other code on the page.

-   **No use of deprecated APIs**

    This reduces the API surface for easier usage and maintenance.




### Prerequisites

Before attempting to migrate or upgrade to a higher SAPUI5 version, make sure that your development does **not** use any undocumented internal framework resources. Also, double check that all compatibility guidelines have been followed, such as those mentioned in [Upgrading](../02_Read-Me-First/upgrading-9638e4f.md).



### Deprecated APIs

In general, **you must not use deprecated APIs** anymore, such as `sap.ui.getCore()`. You can find deprecated APIs in the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/deprecated), in the [What's New Viewer](https://help.sap.com/whats-new/67f60363b57f4ac0b23efd17fa192d60?Type=Deleted%3BDeprecated), and in the reports by our [Support Assistant](../04_Essentials/support-assistant-57ccd7d.md) and [UI5 linter](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-linter). For new projects, we recommend the use of TypeScript, because usage of deprecated APIs can then be detected easily.

Also, see the relevant warnings and errors logged to the browser's dev console during runtime. You might need to increase the `sap-ui-log-level`. For more information, see [Logging and Tracing](../04_Essentials/logging-and-tracing-9f4d62c.md).

Some APIs may be only partially deprecated, for instance passing a non-object `vName` to [`sap.ui.core.theming.Parameters.get`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.theming.Parameters%23methods/sap.ui.core.theming.Parameters.get). Refer to the API Reference for individual APIs. UI5 linter can also help detecting the deprecated usage of such APIs.

Using the native web API `XMLHttpRequest#open` with `false` as the third argument outside of workers is also deprecated, and browsers might end its support. Therefore, in addition to avoiding already deprecated SAPUI5 APIs, you must not call low-level APIs such as `jQuery.ajax` with a disabled `async` option either.

-   [Synchronous `XMLHttpRequest`](https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/#the-open()-method)



### Modules

**Defining and Requiring Modules**

-   Avoid accessing modules via global names.

-   Use `sap.ui.define` for defining a new module, including its eager dependencies.

-   Use `sap.ui.require` for requiring a module lazily at a later point in time.

-   Add only valid module IDs from the API Reference \(documented as Module: .../.../...\) to the dependency list.


For more information, see [Best Practices for Loading Modules](../04_Essentials/best-practices-for-loading-modules-00737d6.md).

**Third-Party Libraries**

When requiring third-party libraries that export global names and support AMD at the same time, ensure having a `shim` with `amd:true` defined via [`sap.ui.loader.config`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.loader%23methods/sap.ui.loader.config) beforehand. Use the required module value instead of the global name of the third-party library.

**Troubleshooting**

Identify and resolve cyclic dependencies with the help of the SAPUI5 configuration parameter `sap-ui-xx-debug-module-loading=true`. Identified modules are logged in the browser console \([F12\]\) with the message '**cycle detected**'. Ensure that the console shows all levels of logs incl. "Verbose" ones to see this message.

## App Development

In the following we'll focus on crucial aspects of app development, specifically on asynchronous loading and best practices around Components, Controllers, Views, Fragments, and Models.



### Asynchronous Loading

-   Use asynchronous loading for views, fragments, and components to enhance performance; see, for example, [Deprecated Factories Replacement](../04_Essentials/deprecated-factories-replacement-491bd9c.md).
-   Implement the `sap.ui.core.IAsyncContentCreation` marker interface in your [Component.js file](../04_Essentials/component-controller-27ce0e4.md) to allow the content to be created fully asynchronously and for a stricter handling of certain types of errors during its view processing.
-   Make sure that dependent libraries and components are preloaded before modules from the respective preload are accessed. For example, if the `sap.f.FlexibleColumnLayout` control is part of the root view, `"sap.f": {}` should be included in the `sap.ui5/dependencies/libs` section of the `manifest.json`. Avoid setting `{ "lazy": true }` if the application does not intend to preload the bundle manually. For more information, see [Ensure that Library Preloads are Enabled](../05_Developing_Apps/performance-speed-up-your-app-408b40e.md#loio408b40efed3c416681e1bd8cdd8910d4__section_LibraryPreloads).

-   [Performance: Speed Up Your App](../05_Developing_Apps/performance-speed-up-your-app-408b40e.md)



### SAPUI5 Object Creation

When creating instances of SAPUI5 controls programmatically \(i.e. not declaratively via XML View or Fragment\), then:

-   Don't use the global name of a control. Require the corresponding module dependency instead.
-   Use `createId` to ensure there are no ID collisions, e.g. [`sap.ui.core.mvc.View#createId`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.mvc.View%23methods/createId) to prefix the control's ID with the view ID.

**Additional Information:**

-   [Use Stable IDs](use-stable-ids-79e910e.md)



### Data Binding

-   When creating data binding programmatically, add the data types to the dependency list and create instances on your own. Do **not** specify their global names.

-   When an [Expression Binding](../04_Essentials/expression-binding-daf6852.md) refers to any of the built-in global symbols `odata.compare`, `odata.fillUriTemplate`, or `odata.uriEncode`, the corresponding modules must be required by the surrounding code \(either via [`template:require`](../04_Essentials/require-263f6e5.md), [`core:require`](../04_Essentials/require-modules-in-xml-view-and-fragment-b11d853.md), or in the controller code\):

    -   `odata.compare`: `sap/ui/model/odata/v4/ODataUtils`
    -   `odata.fillUriTemplate`: `sap/ui/thirdparty/URITemplate`
    -   `odata.uriEncode`: `sap/ui/model/odata/ODataUtils`
    -   To cover **all** built-in global symbols of the `odata` namespace at once, you can import `sap/ui/model/odata/ODataExpressionAddons`


**Additional Information:**

-   [Require Modules in XML View and Fragment](../04_Essentials/require-modules-in-xml-view-and-fragment-b11d853.md)
-   [XML Templating](../04_Essentials/xml-templating-5ee619f.md)



### Standalone Apps

-   During SAPUI5 bootstrapping, assign `module:sap/ui/core/ComponentSupport` or a separate JavaScript file to `data-sap-ui-on-init`.

-   Avoid inline scripts or inline styles.


**Additional Information:**

-   [Declarative API for Initial Components](../04_Essentials/declarative-api-for-initial-components-82a0fce.md)



### Component / `manifest.json`

**Component Creation**

-   To create a root component, favor leveraging the `sap/ui/core/ComponentSupport` module over the `sap.ui.core.ComponentContainer`.

-   When creating a component via `sap.ui.core.ComponentContainer`, avoid setting a falsy value to the `manifest` property if the `async` property is kept undefined. Do not set the `async` property to `false`.

-   `sap.ui.core.Component#createComponent` must not be used with `async: false`.


**`manifest.json`**

-   Don't use the section `sap.ui5/resources/js` as it's deprecated. Use regular dependencies in the `Component.js` file instead.

-   Unless the component intends to load specific SAPUI5 libraries manually on demand, avoid adding `{ lazy: true }` to the `sap.ui5/dependencies/libs` section.


**Dependency Management**

Before using the Component's `EventBus` instance via `Component#getEventBus`, define the `sap/ui/core/EventBus` as a dependency in your component controller \(`Component.js`\).

**Bundling**

Prevent bundling modules \(`Component-preload.js`\) into strings.

-   Avoid generating the application bundle with an outdated standard Grunt task. Leverage UI5 Tooling to build the bundle.

-   Avoid declaring `var`, `let`, or `const` in the global scope above `sap.ui.define`. If absolutely required, replace e.g. `var myGlobal` with `globalThis.myGlobal` and/or wrap the module definition in an *Immediately Invoked Function Expression* \(IIFE\) if applicable.

-   For third-party libraries that have to define variables globally or must be exempted from being modified \(e.g. due to legal or license reasons\), [exclude them from the bundle](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/v3/pages/Configuration/#excludes).




### Controller / Views / Fragments

-   Don't use views of type `HTMLView`, `JSView`, or `JSONView` as they are deprecated. Use `XMLView` or [Typed View](../04_Essentials/typed-view-e6bb33d.md) instead.

-   Don't use `sap.ui.getCore().byId()` or `Element.getElementById()`. Use `this.byId()` or `this.getView().byId()` to address controls in your views or fragments.

-   Don't use native HTML, SVG, or inline CSS style within your XML view or fragment. Instead, consider using the [`sap.ui.core.HTML`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.HTML) control or your own notepad control. Existing inline CSS must be migrated to an external style sheet.

-   Don't use view cloning via `sap.ui.core.mvc.View#clone` as it's deprecated. Instead, call the respective factory function \(e.g. `XMLView.create`\) with the View's name.

-   Use the `loadFragment` method of the `sap.ui.core.mvc.Controller` to load fragments asynchronously.

-   Don't use global names in your XML. Ensure that the target function or object is defined as a module and require the defined module via [`core:require` in the XML](../04_Essentials/require-modules-in-xml-view-and-fragment-b11d853.md). Use `template:require` if the XML content needs preprocessing.

-   [Formatting, Parsing, and Validating Data](../04_Essentials/formatting-parsing-and-validating-data-07e4b92.md)



### Models

-   Take care of destroying programmatically created models to prevent memory leaks.

-   Built-in framework models \(such as `ODataModel` or `JSONModel`\) and their related classes are considered *final*. They must not be modified or extended. For more information, see [Custom Model](../04_Essentials/custom-model-91f1c7e.md).


**OData V4 Model**

-   When using computed annotations, do **not** use global names; use `template:require` instead.

-   Don't use the [`synchronizationMode`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel%23constructor) as it's deprecated.


**OData V2 Model**

-   [`v2.ODataModel#createEntry`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel%23methods/createEntry): Defining an array for the `mParameters.properties` is deprecated since SAPUI5 1.120. Pass the initial values as an object instead.

-   [`v2.ODataModel#refreshSecurityToken`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel%23methods/refreshSecurityToken): Pass `true` for the `bAsync` parameter explicitly as its default value is `false`.


**JSON Model**

[`JSONModel#loadData`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.json.JSONModel%23methods/loadData): Do **not** pass `false` to the `bAsync` and `bCache` parameters, which are deprecated.

**Additional Information:**

-   [Meta Model for OData V4](../04_Essentials/meta-model-for-odata-v4-7f29fb3.md)
-   OData V2 Model: [Creating Entities](../04_Essentials/odata-v2-model-6c47b2b.md#loio4c4cd99af9b14e08bb72470cc7cabff4)



### Strict Error Handling

Implement strict error handling to address critical issues.

-   Ensure that the minimum log level includes warnings \(e.g. `sap-ui-log-level=WARNING`\).

-   Starting with SAPUI5 1.120.2, check for `[FUTURE FATAL]` log messages in the browser dev console.

-   Starting with SAPUI5 1.121, use the experimental URL parameter `sap-ui-xx-future=true` to enforce throwing exceptions for fatal warnings and errors.

-   Starting with SAPUI5 2.0, critical findings will throw exceptions by default, requiring prior resolution.

## Control Development



### Control Rendering

-   Ensure a dependency on the renderer or embed it within the control class.

-   Migrate to the rendering `apiVersion 2` or `apiVersion 4`. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.RenderManager%23overview).

-   When utilizing [`RenderManager#icon`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.RenderManager%23methods/icon) during rendering, include a dependency to `sap/ui/core/IconPool` in your code.

-   Don't rely on [`rerender`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.Control%23methods/rerender) as it is deprecated.

-   Avoid overriding `invalidate` for unintended purposes. Custom logic before or after rendering should be implemented in `onBeforeRendering` or `onAfterRendering`. The actual rendering should be implemented in the `render` function of the control's renderer.
-   Let the framework handle the invalidation instead of calling `invalidate` directly. It takes care of properly invalidating all affected controls, for example, when a managed control state changes via generated mutators or data binding.

**Additional Information:**

-   [`RenderManager`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.RenderManager)
-   [SAPUI5 Control Development Guidelines](../09_Developing_Controls/sapui5-control-development-guidelines-4549da6.md)



<a name="loio28fcd55b04654977b63dacbee0552712__section_gjb_rs1_f1c"/>

## Library Development



### Library Dependency and Init

-   Don't use `sap.ui.getCore().initLibrary` to initialize the library as it's deprecated. Use the import of `sap/ui/core/Lib` and call its [`Lib.init()`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.Lib%23methods/sap.ui.core.Lib.init) instead.

-   Don't use the global namespace of the library to add types. Use the return value of `Lib.init` instead to add them.

-   Migrate to the library `apiVersion 2`. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.Lib%23methods/sap.ui.core.Lib.init).

-   Use [`sap.ui.base.DataType.registerEnum`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.base.DataType%23methods/sap.ui.base.DataType.registerEnum) to register enums that shall be usable as a type of control properties.

-   Define the `appData/manifest/i18n` section in the `.library` file or the `sap.app/i18n` section in the `manifest.json`, so that the framework can load resource bundles in advance.

-   Properly define library dependencies in all places where it is required. For more information, see [Dependencies to Libraries](../04_Essentials/descriptor-dependencies-to-libraries-and-components-8521ad1.md#loio8521ad1955f340f9a6207d615c88d7fd__section_DEPLIB).

-   [Defining Control Properties](../09_Developing_Controls/defining-control-properties-ac56d92.md)
-   [Descriptor for Applications, Components, and Libraries \(manifest.json\)](../04_Essentials/descriptor-for-applications-components-and-libraries-manifest-json-be0cf40.md)



### Bundling

Prevent bundling modules \(`library-preload.js`\) into strings.

-   Avoid generating the library bundle with an outdated standard Grunt task. Leverage UI5 Tooling to build the bundle.

-   Avoid declaring `var`, `let`, or `const` in the global scope above `sap.ui.define`.

-   For third-party libraries, set `requiresTopLevelScope="false"` to the `/library/appData/packaging/raw-module` tag within the `.library` file, **provided that** the third-party library is allowed to be bundled together and does not require access to the global scope. Otherwise, consider [excluding the third-party library from the bundle](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/v3/pages/Configuration/#excludes_1).




<a name="loio28fcd55b04654977b63dacbee0552712__section_dkp_ws1_f1c"/>

## Testing

-   When replacing deprecated APIs with their successors, additional care has to be taken in the test code. Sometimes, deprecated APIs have been handled via spies or stubs in tests. As the SAPUI5 framework also replaces calls to deprecated APIs, such **stubs or spies might no longer achieve what they're expected to achieve**. As creating spies or stubs usually involves a different syntax than that for normal calls, alternative search patterns might be required to identify such spies or stubs

-   SAPUI5 entities that have previously been looked up via their global name \(controls, controllers, components\) are now looked up as modules.

    -   If tests create implementations of such entities, they must be implemented in a way that a module lookup can find them: either as individual files or as embedded and named `sap.ui.define` statements.
    -   As modules can only be loaded and executed once, each test implementation must have a unique module name. The same name cannot be used multiple times as was the case with globals.

-   Migrate an existing QUnit and OPA test setup to the [Test Starter](../04_Essentials/test-starter-032be2c.md) concept.
-   Transform existing QUnit tests that are based on the outdated QUnit 1 version to using QUnit 2.
-   Do not rely on the outdated Blanket.js \(`qunit-coverage.js`\) anymore. As of SAPUI5 1.113, code coverage measurement via IstanbulJS \(`qunit-coverage-istanbul.js`\) is the recommended option. For more information, see [Code Coverage Measurement](../04_Essentials/code-coverage-measurement-7ef3242.md).
