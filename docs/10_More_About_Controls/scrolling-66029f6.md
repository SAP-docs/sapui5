# Scrolling

Because of limited size of mobile devices, scrolling is an essential topic in mobile user experience. Smooth and easy scrolling is important for user acceptance of mobile applications.

In general, application programmers do not need to take care of scrolling when using the sap.m control library. Scrolling is provided automatically by the following controls:

-   `sap.m.Page`
-   `sap.m.Dialog`
-   `sap.m.Popover`
-   `sap.m.ScrollContainer`
