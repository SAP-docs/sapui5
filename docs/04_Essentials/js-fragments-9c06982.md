# JS Fragments

The structure of JS fragments is similar to the structure of the respective views: They have a name and an object with a `createContent()` function.

You define a simple JS fragment named `my.useful.UiPartX` as shown in the following code snippet:

```js
// The fragment is available under the resource name "my/useful/UiPartX.js"
sap.ui.define(["sap/m/Button"], function(Button) {
	return {
		createContent: function(oController) {
			var oButton  = new Button({
				text: "Hello World" ,
				press:oController.doSomething
			});
			return oButton;
		}
	}; 
});
```

The `createContent()` function is responsible for the UI definition and has to return a control. The definition can be created either inline or in a separate file, for instance in `â€¦/my/useful/UiPartX.js`. The `oController` is either already defined or it is `null`. In the first case, its methods can be used for the event handlers of controls.

Despite the many similarities to views, there are also differences: First of all, there is no `getControllerName()` or `getControllerModuleName()` method. Fragments cannot specify whether they have a controller. Whether `oController` is defined or not is not a decision of the fragment itself. Instead, it is decided by the code instantiating the fragment. If that code is part of a controller, it can pass a reference to itself to the fragment. This means there can be a dependency between controllers and fragments: Fragments may expect a controller to exist and to have certain methods. And controllers may expect certain controls to be in the fragment. This is in line with the purpose of fragments - to be very lightweight reuse entities that provide little encapsulation. For more encapsulation, views or even components are better suited.
