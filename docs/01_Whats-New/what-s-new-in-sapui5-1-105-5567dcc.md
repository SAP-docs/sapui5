**Deactivation of Default Time Zone Configuration Feature**

We needed to deactivate the feature to configure the default time zone via the time zone configuration option in [`sap.ui.core.Configuration`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.Configuration) and the API method [`sap.ui.core.Configuration.setTimezone`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.Configuration/methods/setTimezone). Reason: There was a risk that dates are visualized by one day off. This wrong date might have been persisted to the back end.

This feature was introduced with UI5 1.102.0. The following UI5 versions still contain this feature:

-   1.102.0 to 1.102.5
-   1.103
-   1.104

If you are on one of these releases, we recommend that you upgrade to a higher version where this feature is deactivated.

We plan to bring this feature back in a different form at a later point in time.

**Reminder: Outdated SAPUI5 Versions to Be Removed from the CDN**

For security reasons, SAPUI5 versions that are no longer maintained will be removed from the UI5 content delivery network \(CDN\) one year after their end of maintenance. If a version is still in maintenance, patches of that version that are older than one year will also be removed. We have noted that a number of customers are still using such outdated versions or patches. If this affects you, please note that once these versions or patches are removed, your applications will break. Please update to a more recent version or patch. For more information, see: [Removing Outdated UI5 Versions from UI5 CDN](https://blogs.sap.com/2021/01/26/removing-outdated-ui5-versions-from-ui5-cdn/) as well as the UI5 notifications in the Demo Kit.

**Stricter Validation of Decimal and Grouping Separators**

If a user added grouping separators when entering a number, the parsing logic ignored them. This could result in an unwanted number if the user confused grouping separators and decimal separators. Since SAPUI5 1.99, the grouping separators are checked against the current locale to largely prevent that the user confuses these types of separators.

In certain cases, a busy indicator unneccessarily prevents the user from entering data in object page forms. We will remove the busy indicator in these cases so that data entry is possible.

## Improved Features


<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model**

We have started to work on supporting recursive hierarchies and deferred deletion. Both features are work in progress. As of now, they are flagged as experimental and must not be used for productive applications. For more information, see [Recursive Hierarchy](../04_Essentials/extension-for-data-aggregation-7d91431.md#loio7d914317c0b64c23824bf932cc8a4ae1__section_RCH) and [Deleting an Entity](../04_Essentials/deleting-an-entity-2613ebc.md).

</tr>

<a name="loio5567dccb287b4dd9aa755a76cf25ae41__section_rqn_wd5_zcb"/>

## Improved Controls


<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**`sap.m.Dialog`**

We have enabled a new keyboard shortcut for `sap.m.Dialog` with a footer button of type *Accept* or *Emphasized*. Buttons can be triggered by pressing  [Ctrl\] + [Enter\]  for Windows and  [Ctrl\] + [Enter\] / [Cmd\] + [Enter\]  for Mac OS. For more information, see the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.m.Dialog/sample/sap.m.sample.Dialog). 



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**`sap.m.IllustratedMessage`**

We have enabled vertical responsiveness for the control. The `sap.m.IllustratedMessage` is adjusted automatically, depending also on the available height. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.IllustratedMessage). 



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**`sap.m.List`**

-   To improve accessibility, we have replaced the existing ARIA roles. The following new default roles are available:

    -   `role=list` for lists

    -   `role=listitem` for list items


-   We have also improved the accessibility for the group headers of grouped lists by, for example, adding the ARIA role `role=group`.




</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**`sap.ui.comp.smartfield.SmartField`**

If rendered as `sap.m.Select`, the `SmartField` control now supports `In` and `Out` parameters of the `ValueList` annotation.

You can achieve this rendering using the following configuration:

```
<smartField:configuration>
    <smartField:Configuration controlType="selection"/>
</smartField:configuration>

```

For more information, see the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.comp.smartfield.SmartField/sample/sap.ui.comp.sample.smartfield.WithValueListAndInOutParameters).



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**`sap.ui.comp.smartfilterbar.SmartFilterBar`**

We have introduced a new button in the header of the *Adapt Filters* dialog. As a key user, you can now use this new button to add custom fields during UI adaptation at runtime.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**`sap.ui.integration.widgets.Card`**

We have introduced the `tooltip` property, which is used to provide more information to the user about what will happen after they click the link and the action is executed. It can be used by `ObjectGroupItems` of type `Default` with actions â€“ for example, link, email, or phone. For more information, see the [Object Card](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/typesDeclarative/object) section and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/object) in the Card Explorer.

## SAP Fiori Elements


<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

The following changes and new features are available for SAP Fiori elements for OData V2:

-   In draft-enabled applications, you can now trigger the validation of a complete object by pressing [Enter\] on any of the object page fields. For more information, see [Draft Handling](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/draft-handling-ed9aa41.md).

-   In draft-enabled applications, busy indicators that appear during the side effects execution are now removed to enable faster data entry.




</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

The following changes and new features are available for SAP Fiori elements for OData V4:

-   You can now link the `Table` building block to a `FilterBar` that is defined in the same view, or to a different one, by referencing the ID of the `FilterBar`. For more information, see [Building Blocks](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/building-blocks-24c1304.md).

-   You can now define a custom filter as mandatory. For more information, see the section *Custom Filter Fields Marked as Mandatory* in [Adding Custom Fields to the Filter Bar](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/adding-custom-fields-to-the-filter-bar-5fb9f57.md).
