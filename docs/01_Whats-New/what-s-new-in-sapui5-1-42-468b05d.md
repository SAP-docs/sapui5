**`sap.f.DynamicPage`**

This control is an SAP Fiori 2.0 control, designed to support the basic SAP Fiori 2.0 floorplans. You can use this control as a basic layout for an app. It consists of a title, a header, content area, and a floating footer. It offers dynamic behavior when scrolling, where part of the header snaps to the title. It offers additional capabilities, such as expanding or snapping the header when clicking on the title, pinning or unpinning the header so that it always stays expanded, and more.

  
  
**Expanded Mode**

**Collapsed Mode**

![](images/WhatsNew_142_DynamicPageSnapped_a4eb968.png "Collapsed Mode")

There is an option for displaying a footer as a toolbar with additional actions. The footer is also known as a “floating footer”, as it appears to float above the content of the page. The benefit of the new footer look-and-feel is that it is easily recognized by the end user.

For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.f.DynamicPage) and the [Samples](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.f.DynamicPage).

**`sap.ui.comp.smartmicrochart.SmartRadialMicroChart`**

The `SmartRadialMicroChart` control has been added to the `SmartMicroChart` container in `sap.ui.comp` library. The control analyzes the metadata document of an OData service for the specified entity set and renders the respective `RadialMicroChart` control for its visualization. As in other `SmartMicroCharts`, the `SmartRadialMicroChart` control uses the OData metadata annotations to determine the binding paths and values inside the chart. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.comp.smartmicrochart.SmartRadialMicroChart) and the [Samples](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.comp.smartmicrochart.SmartRadialMicroChart).

**Behavior-Driven Development with Gherkin**

SAPUI5 now supports behavior-driven development \(BDD\) with Gherkin. Gherkin allows you to write feature files that get translated into executable regression tests. So you can keep your documentation and specification in sync with the actual implementation in your application. It integrates seamlessly with OPA5 and you can completely reuse your OPA and page objects. You only need to translate an OPA journey to a feature file. For more information, see [Behavior-driven Development with Gherkin](../04_Essentials/behavior-driven-development-with-gherkin-45ac9f1.md), the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.test.gherkin), and the [Samples](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.test.gherkin).

> Due to the limited feature scope of this version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, check that all required features are in place before developing applications. Double check the detailed documentation of the features, as certain parts of a feature may be missing although you might expect these parts as given. While we aimed at being compatible with existing controls, some controls might not work due to small incompatibilities compared to `sap.ui.model.odata.(v2.)ODataModel`, or due to missing features in the model \(like tree binding\). The interface for applications has been changed for easier and more efficient use of the model. For a summary of these changes, see [Changes Compared to OData V2 Model](../04_Essentials/changes-compared-to-odata-v2-model-abd4d7c.md).

For more information, see [OData V4 Model](../04_Essentials/odata-v4-model-5de13cf.md), the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4), and the [Samples](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel).

**One Page Acceptance Tests \(OPA5\)**

-   `waitFor` statements in actions and automatic waiting: When writing custom actions you can now add `waitFor` statements inside the `action` and they will be executed before the `success` callback. This allows you to have complex reuse actions that interact with multiple controls.

    There is a new entry `autoWait` in the `sap.ui.test.Opa.config`.

    ```
    Opa5.extendConfig({
            autoWait: true
        });
    
    ```

    If it is set to `true`, every `waitFor` statement will execute extra checks before executing an `action` or `success` to see if the UI is in a stable state. For example, there is automatic waiting for `XMLHttpRequests` \(request to your server\). OPA will not continue before those requests are done. It also works with a mock server that has a delay. For more information, see [API Reference: `sap.ui.test.Opa5.waitFor`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.test.Opa5/methods/waitFor).

-   New matcher `sap.ui.test.matchers.I18NText`: The `I18NText` matcher checks if a control property has the same value as a text from an i18n file. It also checks that the key is in the property file. This allows you to catch all your typos and make your tests independent from the browsers language. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.test.matchers.I18NText) and the [Samples](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.test.matchers.I18NText).

-   Improved troubleshooting: When OPA encounters a timeout, it collects the most recent logs logged under the `sap.ui.test` namespace and puts it in the test's failure message. All parameters of the `waitFor` method are now validated up front to immediately cause the test to fail if there is a typo.

-   Slowing down the execution: You can now use the new URL parameter `paExecutionDelay` to pass on `myOpaTest.qunit.html?opaExecutionDelay=700` to every OPA test. This means there will be a pause for 700 milliseconds before a new `waitFor` statement is executed. It helps when troubleshooting or if you want to watch OPA clicking through your application because it might be too fast to follow. There is also a dropdown list with three predefined values in your QUnit site.

**List Report and Object Page**

General Features:

-   Performance improvements

    Various changes were implemented to improve the overall performance of applications using the templates for the list report and object page.

-   Action control

    You can now control the display of actions. Based on a condition specified in the back-end system, actions can be hidden on the page header level, hidden for inline actions within a table, and disabled when in the toolbar of a table.

    In addition, you can now specify that a user must select at least one item before a particular action is enabled. This functionality is available for actions that trigger a back-end call through the OData service \(function import\).

-   Extension points for custom actions

    You can now use extension points to add custom actions to the list report and the object page.

-   Extension points for determining actions

    You can now use extension points to add a determining action button to the footer of the list report and the object page.

    The following extension points are available for determining actions:

    -   List report: `<Project Name>.ext.controller.ListReportExtension`

    -   Object page: `<Project Name>.ext.controller.DetailsExtension`


-   Smart micro charts in tables

    You can now add a `SmartMicroChart` control to a column within a `SmartTable` control in both the list report and the object page. For example, you may wish to show sales data in chart form for each product in the list report.

-   Enhanced message and error handling

    Message and error handling has been enhanced to improve the usability of the application. A message popover now opens automatically if errors are present when a user saves.


Object Page View

-   Hide or show the `create` action for related entities \(with creatable-path annotation\)

    You can now hide or show the `create` action for entities related to the selected object \(entity\) based on certain conditions set up in your back-end system. For example, you may wish to prevent users from adding a product description after the product has been archived.

-   Actions in smart chart toolbar

    You can now add action buttons to the toolbar of a smart chart on the object page. These actions can be of a type in which a call to the back end is triggered \(`UI.DataFieldForAction`\), or intent-based navigation to another page \(`UI.DataFieldForIntentBasedNavigation`\). For example, you may wish to add a link to an app that is related to the data set shown in the table.


**Overview Page**

Overview pages have been enhanced with the following features:

-   **Changes in stack cards**: With this enhancement, the number of stack cards you can display in an overview page is no longer limited to just 20. We've also added a *View All* link to enable the easy viewing of all the cards stacked. The header for `category` has now been replaced and instead you can now enter a title and description of the card. Also, the place holder of the card has changed and the stack card title can now include a link.

-   **Formatting numbers, date, or time**: Instead of having values rounded up to the next whole integer, the value parameter now supports two decimal points behind the value separator. For dates, you can also enable or disable the relative date format. Timestamp information has also been removed from the card.

-   **Card layout**: To enhance user experience, we've changed the look and feel of the basic card layout by adding a new target parameter to the card itself.
