# Using the *Export* Feature

You can export a table into a spreadsheet or to PDF.

> ### Note:  
> This topic is only applicable to SAP Fiori elements for OData V4. For more information about the export option in SAP Fiori elements for OData V2, see [Adapting the UI: List Report and Object Page](adapting-the-ui-list-report-and-object-page-0d2f1a9.md).

## Export to Spreadsheet

By default, the export feature is enabled in the list report and on the object page. When the feature is enabled, the *Export* button is displayed in the table toolbar. When selected, it exports the values in the table.

To disable the feature in the list report and enable it in the object page, use the `enableExport` property of the manifest of the application and set it to `false` or `true`. In the `controlConfiguration` section of the page, annotate the `LineItem` on which the export should be disabled or enabled, as shown in the following code sample:

> ### Sample Code:  
> `manifest.json`
> 
> ```
> "SalesOrderManageList": {
>    "type": "Component",
>    "id": "SalesOrderManageList",
>    "name": "sap.fe.templates.ListReport",
>    "options": {
>       "settings": {
>          "contextPath": "/SalesOrderManage",
>          "controlConfiguration": {
>             "@com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.LineItem": {
>                "tableSettings": {
>                   "enableExport": false
>                },
>             }
>          }
>       }
>    }
> },
> "SalesOrderManageObjectPage": {
>    "type": "Component",
>    "id": "SalesOrderManageObjectPage",
>    "name": "sap.fe.templates.ObjectPage",
>    "options": {
>       "settings": {
>          "contextPath": "/SalesOrderManage",
>          "controlConfiguration": {
>             "_Item/@com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.LineItem": {
>                "tableSettings": {
>                   "enableExport": true
>                },
>             }
>          }
>       }
>    }
> },
> ```

**Menu Button**

Clicking the export icon starts the export with default settings.

Clicking the drop-down arrow opens a menu with two additional options:

-   *Export*

    Exports the table with default settings.

-   *Export As...*

    Opens a dialog for specifying the export settings:

    -   Split cells with multiple values: when selecting this option, the exported spreadsheet has one column per value. If one column contains multiple values in a cell \(for example, amount and currency/unit\), this results in two separate columns in the spreadsheet. The following list provides all cases that result in multiple columns exported with this mode:

        -   Amount and unit, or price and currency: One column will contain the value or price, the second will contain the unit or currency.

        -   Code and value \(properties annotated with `Text` or `TextArrangement`\): One column will contain the code, the second will contain the description. Note: the `TextArrangement` annotation is not read. The code and the description will always be exported as soon as there is a `Text` annotation.

        -   `dataFieldForAnnotation` pointing to a `DataPoint` with a target value \(rating, progress visualizations\): The value of the property and the target value will be exported into separate columns.

        -   `dataFieldForAnnotation` pointing to a `FieldGroup`: Every property of the `FieldGroup` will be exported into a separate column.

        -   Custom columns with several properties defined: Every defined property of the custom column will be exported into a separate column. See the note below for details.


    -   Include filter settings: the current filter is included on a second sheet in the exported file.

> ### Note:  
> -   You can export the custom columns you have defined using manifest settings. To allow the export of your custom column, you must maintain the `"properties"` array in the definition of the custom column. For more information about defining custom columns, see the *Extension Points for Tables* section in [Extension Points for Tables](extension-points-for-tables-d525522.md). The properties will be exported into the spreadsheet as described for a `FieldGroup`.
> 
> -   If your domain model contains sensitive data \(data annotated as `PersonalData.IsPotentiallySensitive`\), enabling the export to a spreadsheet could lead to exposing this data, as the end user cannot choose where the data will be stored. You can disable the export feature using the `enableExport` property in the manifest. This ensures that access control is enforced and stays within the application.

> ### Restriction:  
> -   The columns containing a multi-input field \(1:N\), `DataFieldForAnnotation` that points to `Charts` or a `DataFieldForAction`, are exported without any content.
> 
> -   Columns containing a property with a dynamic `UI.Hidden` expression are still exported.
> 
> -   The numbers exceeding 15 digits are rounded in the spreadsheet file \(this is a JavaScript restriction\).

You can influence how both regular and custom columns are exported. To do that, set the following properties in the `Columns` key of the `manifest.json`:

-   `type`: Data type of the field. If this property is omitted, the property is processed as a string field. For the list of supported types, see [`sap.ui.export.EdmType`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.export.EdmType).

-   `properties`: A field name or an array of field names in the data source feed.

-   `template`: A formatting template that supports indexed placeholders within curly brackets.

-   `width`: Width of the column in characters. There is no 1:1 correspondence between character widths in the exported spreadsheet and CSS units. The width of one character is approximately 0.5 em in CSS units, depending on the fonts that are used in the table and in the resulting spreadsheet. The default value is 10 characters.


> ### Restriction:  
> This export to spreadsheet configuration is not supported when using the `Table` building block.

## Export to PDF

To enable the export to PDF, you must configure the following annotations at service level:

-   `@Org.OData.Capabilities.V1.SupportedFormats`

    This annotation must contain `"application/pdf"`.

-   `@com.sap.vocabularies.PDF.v1.Feature`

    For more information, see [https://github.com/SAP/odata-vocabularies/blob/main/vocabularies/PDF.md](https://github.com/SAP/odata-vocabularies/blob/main/vocabularies/PDF.md).


> ### Restriction:  
> Export to PDF is not supported for tables containing a column with a multi-input field \(1:N\). Attempting to export the table may lead to a back-end error.



<a name="loio4bab6f2043814257974b52d4dafe1dcd__section_okc_mcp_w1c"/>

## Set the Limit for Request Size

You can configure the limit for the count of records that can be obtained within a single request from the service. To do this, you must configure the `exportRequestSize` parameter in the table settings. The default value of the records that can be obtained within a single request is 1000.

> ### Sample Code:  
> ```
> {
> 	"sap.ui5": {
> 		"routing": {
> 			"targets": {
> 				"SalesOrderManageList": {
> 					"options": {
> 						"settings": {
> 							"controlConfiguration": {
> 								"@com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.LineItem": {
> 									"tableSettings": {
> 										"exportRequestSize":3000
> 									}
> 								}
> 							}
> 						}
> 					}
> 				}
> 			}
> 		}
> 	}
> }
> ```

The Table building block also supports the `exportRequestSize` parameter. For more information about the Table API, see [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.fe.macros.Table%23controlProperties).
