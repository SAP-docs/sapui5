**`sap.ui.mdc.Table`, `sap.ui.mdc.table.DragDropConfig`**

-   We have enhanced the `DropInfo` configuration: You can now use `preventDefault` for the `dragover` event. This way, you can disable dropping on a specific location, for example, between two table rows. To help consumers find out whether to prevent the default of the `dragenter` event when dragging over the edge of two DOM nodes, we have also added the `dropPosition` parameter to the event. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.dnd.DropInfo%23events/dragOver) for the `dragOver` event and the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.mdc.table.DragDropConfig%23events/Summary) for `DragDropConfig`. 

-   We have introduced the `browserEvent` parameter for all drag-and-drop-related events in `DragDropConfig` allowing consumers to access the `DataTransfer` object. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.mdc.table.DragDropConfig).

-   To support time stamps with a long format in the back end, we now convert time stamps with *equal to* conditions to *between* conditions in the *Define Conditions* dialog of *View Settings*.

You can now display the carousel’s page indicator over the content. To enable this behavior, we have created a new `sap.m.CarouselPageIndicatorPlacementType` enumeration, that replaces the old `sap.m.PlacementType`. The new enumeration has two additional values that you can use for this purpose - `OverContentTop` and `OverContentBottom`. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.Carousel) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.m.Carousel/sample/sap.m.sample.CarouselWithDisplayOptions).

-   The rendered card now has a `data-help-id` attribute set on its root element. This `data-help-id` is useful when you want to connect the card with a help system for the end user, for example SAP Companion. For more information, see the [Help ID](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/configuration/helpId) section in the Card Explorer.
