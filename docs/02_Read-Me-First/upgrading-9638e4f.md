-   [The Owner Component](../04_Essentials/the-owner-component-a7a3138.md)
-   [Don't Use Deprecated or Experimental Features](../03_Get-Started/don-t-use-deprecated-or-experimental-features-a8bd1a8.md)
-   For SAPUI5 applications based on SAP Fiori elements: [Read Before Extending a Generated App](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/read-before-extending-a-generated-app-d9c146a.md)
