**Hyphenation for Text Controls**

SAPUI5 now allows you to hyphenate words in multiline texts when controls are in wrapping mode. You can enable hyphenation through the `wrappingType` property for the `sap.m.Text`, `sap.m.Title`, and `sap.m.Label` text controls, or you can use the API of the The hyphenation feature uses third-party and browser-native tools. We are not responsible for any inconsistencies or incorrect grammar. Also, the variety of supported languages is outside the scope of our control and may be subject to future changes.`sap.ui.core.hyphenation.Hyphenation` class directly.

**Support Assistant**

**System Presets**

In addition to the custom rule presets that users can create, we've introduced system-defined presets. They constitute a selection of rules related within the context of a certain scenario, functional area, or other aspects of the application UI that can be checked using support rules. System presets are part of the Support Assistant code and appear by default for all users. They cannot be deleted but can be modified and exported as regular presets.

The first system preset we've introduced is for accessibility-related rules.

![](images/System_Presets_Accessibility_ae05ff4.png)

For more information, see [Rules Management](../04_Essentials/rules-management-3fc864a.md).

**Rule Presets in the Analysis Report**

The Analysis Report now includes information about the rule preset used during the analysis. This information is also available in the downloadable HTML report and in all JSON formats that the API supports, through `jQuery.sap.support.getAnalysisHistory()` and `jQuery.sap.support.getFormattedAnalysisHistory()`.

We have also improved the design of the report itself.

![](images/Presets_in_the_Analysis_Report_d44c5ac.png)

For more information, see [Analysis Report](../04_Essentials/analysis-report-29bcdec.md).

**Support Assistant API**

The `jQuery.sap.support.analyze` method of the Support Assistant API can now accept a rule preset and use it to run an analysis as an alternative to manually listed rule selection. For more information, see [Support Assistant API](../04_Essentials/support-assistant-api-a34eb58.md).

**UI5 Evolution** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

**UI5 Evolution**

UI5 evolutionThe hyphenation feature uses third-party and browser-native represents fundamental improvements that have been introduced into the framework in an ongoing effort to advance SAPUI5, so that it allows applications to run faster and code to become more modular. By embracing web standards and emerging technologies, SAPUI5 continues to be a future-proof, enterprise-proven solution. These innovations are provided in a largely compatible way, encouraging developers to actively support and leverage the new capabilities.

**Modular Core**

Existing modules in the modulare core have been reworked to follow the AMD-like \(asynchronous module definition\) syntax of SAPUI5, which ensures that modules and their dependencies can be loaded and evaluated asynchronously. The Asynchronous Module Definition \(AMD\) specifies a mechanism for defining modules so that the module and its dependencies can be loaded asynchronously. It allows you to avoid accessing modules via global variables and enforces a strict dependency declaration. The documentation has been enhanced accordingly and also made more prominent.For more information, see [Modules and Dependencies](../04_Essentials/modules-and-dependencies-91f23a7.md).

The core part of the framework has improved its modular structure by leveraging SAPUI5's AMD-like features such as [sap.ui.define](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui/methods/sap.ui.define) and [sap.ui.require](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui/methods/sap.ui.require). Already starting with 1.58, the former `jQuery.sap` modules were replaced by new, more granular modules. The new modules are separated either into a regular browser-dependent "UI" layer or into a "base" layer that is independent from the browser-native API and the DOM.For more information, see [Adapting to the Modularization of the Core](../04_Essentials/adapting-to-the-modularization-of-the-core-b8fdf0c.md).

Several mechanisms have been introduced to allow existing applications to continue to run without changes. Nevertheless, all SAPUI5 projects should start to migrate their code and leverage the new core modules to get rid of the deprecated modules and benefit from current or upcoming improvements, especially towards the AMD-like syntax of SAPUI5.

A comprehensive overview shows how you can replace legacy `jQuery.sap` modules and `jQuery` extensions with new modules or native browser APIs. For more information, see [Deprecated jQuery.sap API Replacement](../04_Essentials/deprecated-jquery-sap-api-replacement-a075ed8.md). The Support Assistant also comes with new rules to help identify legacy code, and best practices for module definition and asynchronous loading are also provided.For more information, see [Best Practices for Loading Modules](../04_Essentials/best-practices-for-loading-modules-00737d6.md).

**Asynchronous API**

In order to benefit from asynchronous behavior and to avoid synchronous requests \(as browsers start to deprecate sync XHR\), future-proof SAPUI5 code should use asynchronous APIs. One important step to get there with your existing code is to replace synchronous factory functions, such as global functions in the `sap.ui` namespace, with asynchronous alternatives. Many asynchronous factories are now available via a consistent and elegant API. The documentation provides examples of former sync factories and their preferred async alternatives.For more information, see [Deprecated Factories Replacement](../04_Essentials/deprecated-factories-replacement-491bd9c.md).

**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model**

The new version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model introduces the following features:

-   Batch requests with `create`, `update`, and `delete` change operations for the same group ID are no longer sent in parallel. The next batch request waits for the previous request to return.

-   The path of a transient context changes to the key predicate path when the new entity is successfully submitted. The key predicate path can be used for binding the entity elsewhere.

-   If the same entity is returned by the operation, the binding parameter of a bound operation is automatically updated.

-   V4 Analytics: We now support grand total calculation without visual grouping.

-   We now support the `ValueList` annotation in addition to the `ValueListMapping` annotation.

-   `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding#create`:

    -   When calling `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding#create`, you no longer have to specify all properties that are used in the binding. If available, the binding provides the default values. If no default values are available, the binding provides null.

    -   The new parameter `bSkipRefresh` suppresses the refresh after the POST request.


-   We have introduced the new binding parameter `$$patchWithoutSideEffects` for context bindings, to avoid updating the UI with the data response of a PATCH request.


> ### Restriction:  
> Due to the limited feature scope of this version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, check that all required features are in place before developing applications. Check the detailed documentation of the features, as certain parts of a feature may be missing. While we aim to be compatible with existing controls, some controls might not work due to small incompatibilities compared to `sap.ui.model.odata.(v2.)ODataModel`, or due to missing features in the model \(such as tree binding\). This also applies to smart controls \(`sap.ui.comp` library\) and SAP Fiori elements that do not support the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, as well as controls such as `TreeTable` and `AnalyticalTable`, which are not supported together with the SAPUI5 OData V4 model. The interface for applications has been changed for easier and more efficient use of the model. For a summary of these changes, see [Changes Compared to OData V2 Model](../04_Essentials/changes-compared-to-odata-v2-model-abd4d7c.md).

For more information, see [OData V4 Model](../04_Essentials/odata-v4-model-5de13cf.md), the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4), and the [Samples](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel).

**Aggregation Forwarding for Composite Controls** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

**Aggregation Forwarding for Composite Controls**

Aggregation forwarding for composite controls now offers the following options:

-   Child controls in a public, forwarded aggregation are now automatically cloned by the framework together with the composite control.

-   You can now define forwarding from a single \(to-1\) to a multiple aggregation \(to-n\).

-   A control that has been forwarded will always have the same models as the ones available at the original location **before** the forwarding.

    For example, a model that a composite control developer sets on an inner control is not propagated to the child controls of this inner control if they have been moved there by aggregation forwarding. Instead, the models available at the original location of these child controls will be propagated to them.

**`sap.m.MultiComboBox`**

-   We have implemented a dropdown list with a two-column layout. You can now use the `MultiComboBox` with a two-column layout to display additional information for your options. To enable this feature, you need to set the `showSecondaryValues` property to `true`. This feature was initially available only for the `ComboBox` and has now been enabled for the `MultiComboBox` as well. This property indicates whether the text values of the `additionalText` property of a `sap.ui.core.ListItem` are shown.For more information, see the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/sample/sap.m.sample.MultiComboBoxTwoColumnsLayout/preview).

-   We have introduced grouping in the suggestion list of `sap.m.MultiComboBox`. This feature allows you to easily group items by common characteristics and to display a header describing the characteristics for each group. If data binding is used, grouping is defined on the `Sorter` in data binding. Alternatively, a group header could be added programmatically, as an instance of `sap.ui.core.SeparatorItem` with `key` and/or `text` properties, by adding it to the `items` aggregation of the `sap.m.MultiComboBox` control.For more information, see the [Sample](https://sdk.openui5.org/#/sample/sap.m.sample.MultiComboBoxGrouping/preview).

With the new `sapUxAPObjectPageSubSectionAlignContent` CSS class, you can now vertically align the content of the header with the content of the subsection. When using `sap.ui.layout.form.Form`, `sap.m.Panel`, `sap.m.Table`, and `sap.m.List` in the subsection content area of the `ObjectPageLayout`, if the content is not already aligned, you need to adjust the left text offset to achieve the vertical alignment. To do this, apply the `sapUxAPObjectPageSubSectionAlignContent` CSS class to them and set their `width` property to `auto` \(if not set by default\).

```xml
<Panel class="sapUxAPObjectPageSubSectionAlignContent" width="auto"></Panel>
```

**SAP Fiori Elements**

**General Features**

Customers can extend SAP-delivered SAP Fiori elements-based apps using the SAPUI5 Visual Editor. For more information, see [Extending Delivered Apps Using Adaptation Extensions](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/extending-delivered-apps-using-adaptation-extensions-52fc48b.md). This option is available for list report, object page, and analytical list page.

**List Report and Object Page**

List report and object page have the following new and enhanced features:

**List Report View**

-   In list reports with different entity sets, internal navigation to the object page is now also supported. For more information, see [Defining Multiple Views on a List Report with Different Entity Sets and Table Settings](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/defining-multiple-views-on-a-list-report-with-different-entity-sets-and-table-settings-b6b59e4.md).

-   Users can now display the active version of records in draft-enabled applications.


**Object Page View**

-   The table header is now enabled by default in object page tables. It remains visible when users scroll through the content of a table.

-   The object page dynamic header has been optimized:

    -   The header image has been replaced by an avatar control. By default, the avatar is rendered as a square. For more information, see [Setting Up the Object Page Header](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/setting-up-the-object-page-header-cce93e6.md).

    -   The subtitle is below the title.

    -   The object marker is in the key information area.

    -   The paginator buttons and the layout actions are separated from the global actions by a separator. Depending on the screen size, the layout actions and paginator buttons are placed either on the very right of the global actions toolbar, separated by a divider line, or above the global actions.



**Analytical List Page**

Analytical list page has the following new and enhanced features:

-   You can now configure quick view contact card information in the table columns using the `DataFieldForAnnotation` and `com.sap.vocabularies.Communication.v1.Contact` annotations. For more information, see [Configuring the Table-Only View as the Default Option](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/configuring-the-table-only-view-as-the-default-option-d074e26.md).

-   The new `filterDefaultsFromSelectionVariant` app descriptor setting lets you enable default values for the filter bar using the `SelectionVariant` annotation. For more information, see [Descriptor Configuration for the Analytical List Page](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/descriptor-configuration-for-the-analytical-list-page-2a9df06.md).

-   You can now achieve faster end-to-end response time within the analytical list page by enabling batching of KPIs. You can group KPIs together in a single batch by defining `groupId` in the app descriptor file. For more information, see [Descriptor Configuration for the Analytical List Page](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/descriptor-configuration-for-the-analytical-list-page-2a9df06.md).


**Overview Page**

Overview page has the following new and enhanced features:

-   You can now define:

    -   The `requestAtLeast` property in the `presentationVariant` annotation to include fields as part of the selection fields \(`$Select`\). For more information, see [Annotations Used in Overview Pages](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/annotations-used-in-overview-pages-65731e6.md).

    -   The `UI.dataPoint.valueFormat.scaleFactor` annotation property to define scale factors for large numbers that appear on the overview page cards. For more information, see [Annotations Used in Overview Pages](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/annotations-used-in-overview-pages-65731e6.md).

        For example, if you define the value `scaleFactor = 1000`, the card displays the value as 1K.

    -   Multiple entity sets for the view switch feature on cards. For more information, see [Configuring View Switch](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/configuring-view-switch-931f92d.md).


-   Support for the diagnostics window is now available for overview pages. This is an SAPUI5 support tool that runs within an existing SAPUI5 app. For more information, see [Diagnostics](../04_Essentials/diagnostics-6ec18e8.md#loio6ec18e80b0ce47f290bc2645b0cc86e6).

-   The SAP WebIDE plugin for overview pages now lets you create custom cards and filters, and to add custom global actions. For more information, see [Building an App](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/building-an-app-9834a0a.md).
