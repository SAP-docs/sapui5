**Navigation in Nested Components**

In recent releases, the capabilities to [Navigate with Nested Components](../04_Essentials/navigate-with-nested-components-8e9d6e4.md) were enhanced significantly. In addition to the available documentation, a [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.core.routing.Router/sample/sap.ui.core.sample.RoutingNestedComponent) has been added to showcase some fundamental possibilities of using components to structure applications and how to interconnect them via routing. 



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**Negative Predefined CSS Margin Classes**

We’ve introduced the following negative CSS margin classes to help you align controls that have their own default margins:

-   `sapUiTinyNegativeMarginBeginEnd`

-   `sapUiSmallNegativeMarginBeginEnd`

-   `sapUiMediumNegativeMarginBeginEnd`

-   `sapUiLargeNegativeMarginBeginEnd`


For more information, see [Using Predefined CSS Margin Classes](../04_Essentials/using-predefined-css-margin-classes-777168f.md)and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.core.StandardMargins/sample/sap.m.sample.StandardNegativeMarginsTwoSided).



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**Responsive Padding Enablement**

We've introduced responsive paddings to the `sap.m.IconTabBar`, `sap.m.ObjectHeader`, and `sap.m.TabContainer` controls. For more information, see [Enabling Responsive Paddings According to the Control Width](../04_Essentials/enabling-responsive-paddings-according-to-the-control-width-3b718b5.md).



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model**

The new version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model introduces the following features:

-   The `autoExpandSelect:true` model setting has been enhanced for property bindings that are added later.

-   We have added the `sap.ui.model.v4.ODataListBinding.getDownloadUrl` method.
-   `sap.ui.model.v4.AnnotationHelper.format` can now be used for operation parameters.
-   For messages returned in error responses of operation calls, targets pointing to operation parameters are now parsed correctly.
-   The `sap.ui.model.v4.Context.setProperty` method can be used to set properties locally on the client by specifying `null` as the `groupId`. The set value is then not included in PATCH and POST requests to create the new entity.
-   Annotation targets for \(overloaded\) bound operations in 4.01 Format are also supported in value list metadata.

> ### Restriction:  
> Due to the limited feature scope of this version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, check that all required features are in place before developing applications. Double-check the detailed documentation of the features, as certain parts of a feature may be missing. While we aim to be compatible with existing controls, some controls might not work due to small incompatibilities compared to `sap.ui.model.odata.(v2.)ODataModel`, or due to missing features in the model \(such as tree binding\). This also applies to smart controls \(`sap.ui.comp` library\) that do not support the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, as well as controls such as `TreeTable` and `AnalyticalTable`, which are not supported in combination with the SAPUI5 OData V4 model. The interface for applications has been changed for easier and more efficient use of the model. For a summary of these changes, see [Changes Compared to OData V2 Model](../04_Essentials/changes-compared-to-odata-v2-model-abd4d7c.md).

For more information, see [OData V4 Model](../04_Essentials/odata-v4-model-5de13cf.md), the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4), and the [Samples](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel) in the Demo Kit.

## Improved Controls


<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**`sap.m.Avatar`**

</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**`sap.m.DateRangeSelection`**

We have introduced the ability to select month and year ranges. This improves the user experience when only a month or a year range has to be selected, and is defined by the `displayFormat` property. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.DateRangeSelection) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.m.DateRangeSelection/sample/sap.m.sample.DateRangeSelection).



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**`sap.m.List, sap.m.Table, sap.m.Tree`**

The busy indicator is now displayed in the center of the visible area of the UIs of these controls and is no longer vertically centered and therefore not always visible. For more information, see the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.m.List/sample/sap.m.sample.ListDeletion).



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**`sap.m.NavContainer`**

In version 1.69, the default value for the `defaultTransitionName` property was visually updated to behave as a slide & fade animation and the classic slide animation was no longer an option. Now, we've added the previous slide behavior as a new type of transition. To use it, set the `defaultTransitionName` property to `baseSlide`.For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.NavContainer) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.m.NavContainer/sample/sap.m.sample.NavContainer).



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**`sap.m.NotificationListItem`**

The avatar background color can now be managed by the application developer using the new `authorAvatarColor` property.

<td valign="top">

**`sap.m.plugins.DataStateIndicator`**

This plugin for the table controls \(`sap.m.List, sap.m.Table, sap.ui.table.Table`\) allows you to implement binding-related messages and show them on the UI using a message strip. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.plugins.DataStateIndicator) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.comp.smarttable.SmartTable/sample/sap.ui.comp.sample.smarttable.mtableDataState).



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**`sap.m.Select`**

With the new `required` property, you can now indicate whether user input is required. This property is helpful for accessibility purposes when a single relationship between the field and a label can't be established, for example, when one label exists for multiple fields.For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.Select).



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**`sap.m.StandardListItem`**

The new `infoStateInverted` property changes the rendering behavior of the information state and information text. If it is set to `true`, the color defined by the `infoState` property is then shown as the background color of the information text. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.StandardListItem) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.m.StandardListItem/sample/sap.m.sample.StandardListItemInfoStateInverted).



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**`sap.m.Table`**

A more comprehensive message text is now shown if no data is available because all table columns are hidden. For more information, see the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.m.Table/sample/sap.m.sample.TablePerso).



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**`sap.m.ViewSettingsDialog`**

We have introduced a new button to display only the selected items in the filter tab, and to hide items that are not selected. This button works in combination with the Search field, so the displayed items are both filtered by title and selection. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.ViewSettingsDialog) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.m.ViewSettingsDialog/sample/sap.m.sample.ViewSettingsDialog).



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**`sap.m.Wizard`**

We have enhanced the `sap.m.Wizard` control for better integration in the `sap.f.DynamicPage`. In order to make use of it, you need to make certain configurations. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.Wizard). 



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**`sap.tnt.InfoLabel`**

We have introduced the option to add an icon to the `sap.tnt.InfoLabel` content. It is defined by the new `icon` property. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.tnt.InfoLabel) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.tnt.InfoLabel/sample/sap.tnt.sample.InfoLabel).

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**`sap.ui.comp.smartfield.SmartField, sap.ui.comp.smartfilterbar.SmartFilterBar`**

We've introduced support for fiscal dates. The service metadata property must be of type `Edm.String` annotated with one of the fiscal annotations \(`IsFiscalYear`, `IsFiscalPeriod`, `IsFiscalYearPeriod`, `IsFiscalQuarter`, `IsFiscalYearQuarter`, `IsFiscalWeek`, `IsFiscalYearWeek`, `IsDayOfFiscalYear`\).For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.comp.smartfield.SmartField) for `SmartField`, the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.comp.smartfield.SmartFilterBar) for `SmartFilterBar` and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.comp.smartfilterbar.SmartFilterBar/sample/sap.ui.comp.sample.smartfilterbar.FiscalDates) for `SmartFilterBar`.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**`sap.ui.comp.smartfilterbar.SmartFilterBar, sap.ui.comp.smarttable.SmartTable`**

We've updated the available exclude operators to match the include operators for each field type. The change affects the *Define Conditions* tab of the `ValueHelpDialog` in `SmartFilterBar` and the *Filter* tab of `TablePersoDialog` in `SmartTable`.For more information, see the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.comp.smartfilterbar.SmartFilterBar/sample/sap.ui.comp.sample.smartfilterbar.example1) for `SmartFilterBar` and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.comp.smarttable.SmartTable/sample/sap.ui.comp.sample.smarttable) for `SmartTable`.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**`sap.ui.comp.valuehelpdialog.ValueHelpDialog`**

We've improved the behavior of the `ValueHelpDialog` basic search for `SmartFilterBar` and `SmartField`. Now, only the entered \(or modified\) value is taken over into the basic search. The search is triggered automatically when the dialog opens and takes over the value into the basic search \(if it’s not empty\). Only the entered characters are taken, regardless if the suggestion list is displaying a typeahead.For more information, see the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.comp.smartfield.SmartField/sample/sap.ui.comp.sample.smartfield.SmartFieldWithValueHelp) for `SmartField` and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.comp.smartfilterbar.SmartFilterBar/sample/sap.ui.comp.sample.smartfilterbar.example1) for `SmartFilterBar`.
