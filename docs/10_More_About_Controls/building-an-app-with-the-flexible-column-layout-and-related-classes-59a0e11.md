# Building an App with the Flexible Column Layout and Related Classes

The following sections provide you with best practices and details that help you develop SAP Fiori 2.0 apps with the `sap.f.FlexibleColumnLayout` control.

The simplest way to build an app with the `sap.f.FlexibleColumnLayout` is to create an instance of the control as a top-level container in the root view of your component and then use the `sap.f.routing.Router` to manipulate the control upon user interaction.

On each significant user action, query the `sap.f.FlexibleColumnLayoutSemanticHelper` class for the recommended layout and action buttons to show.
