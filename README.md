# Contributions to the SAPUI5 Documentation

Found a mistake in our documentation? Always wanted to add a step in one of our procedures that could save many others much time? Then you're at the right place! All contributions made to the Markdown files in the [docs](docs) directory are reviewed, and if deemed valuable be added to our [official documentation in the SAPUI5 Demo Kit](https://ui5.sap.com/#/topic). The easiest way is to start there, and choose _Edit on GitHub_ to find the right Markdown file to contribute to.

## Requirements

For contributions, it's required that you have a GitHub account. For more information, see [Signing up for a new GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account) in the GitHub documentation.


## Contributing

We recommend using the SAPUI5 documentation in the SAPUI5 Demo Kit as a starting point for contributions:

1. Open the [SAPUI5 Documentation](https://ui5.sap.com/#/topic).
1. Choose *Edit* to suggest a change for the current page you see in the SAPUI5 Demo Kit.

If you only make a small contribution, that's the quickest way to propose a change. For larger contributions, we recommend forking this repository to work locally. The filenames in the [docs](docs) directory are created based on the title of the page in the SAPUI5 Demo Kit.
