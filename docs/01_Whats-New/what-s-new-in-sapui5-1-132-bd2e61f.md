**SAP Fiori Elements for OData V4**

The following changes and new features are available for SAP Fiori elements for OData V4:

-   By default, we now display 10 fixed rows in a tree or analytical table on an object page when the table is not the sole control in the section or when the `sectionLayout` is set to `Page`. For more information, see [Setting the Table Type](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/setting-the-table-type-7f844f1.md).

-   You can now use the `VariantManagement` building block. For more information, see [The VariantManagement Building Block](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/the-variantmanagement-building-block-33640ff.md).

-   We no longer show the *Open in New Tab* option in the context menu if the object page is set to open in edit mode. For more information, see [Tables](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/tables-c0f6592.md) and [Navigation to an Object Page in Edit Mode](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/navigation-to-an-object-page-in-edit-mode-8665847.md).
-   We now support displaying a hierarchy within a value help. For more information, see [Field Help](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/field-help-a5608ea.md).
-   Key users can now split and combine actions in tables on the object page and in the list report. For more information, see [Enabling an App for Key User Adaptation](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/enabling-an-app-for-key-user-adaptation-ccd45ba.md).
-   We've implemented the `DataFieldForActionGroup` annotation, which allows the grouping of actions and their rendering within menu buttons. For more information, see [Actions](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/actions-cbf16c5.md).
-   We now sort the values in columns by their unit of measure or currency first, followed by the values themselves. For more information, see [Enabling Table Personalization](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/enabling-table-personalization-3e2b4d2.md) and [Configuring Default Settings \(Visualizations, Sort Order, Filter Values\)](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/configuring-default-settings-visualizations-sort-order-filter-values-49a6ba5.md).
-   We now support using an absolute path as the target entity for side effects events in a list report. For more information, see [Event-Driven Side Effects](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/event-driven-side-effects-27c9c3b.md).

**Types and Formatters**

The new version of SAPUI5 introduces the following features:

-   The `decimals` format option of `sap.ui.model.type.Unit` and `sap.ui.model.odata.type.Unit` now defaults to 3 decimals if none of the `decimals`, `maxFractionDigits`, or `minFractionDigits` format options is set.

-   We have provided the new `decimalPadding` format option for the currency, float, and unit instances of `sap.ui.core.format.NumberFormat`. This format option is also available for types using the respective `NumberFormat` instances. In particular, it is available for `sap.ui.model.odata.type.Currency` and `sap.ui.model.odata.type.Unit`.

    For more information, see the API Reference for [`NumberFormat`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.format.NumberFormat), [`Currency`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.type.Currency), and [`Unit`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.type.Unit).
