## Adaptation by Application Developers

App developers can adapt the UI at design time.

For information about the features that application developers can adapt in SAP Fiori elements for OData V2, see [Adapting the UI: List Report and Object Page](adapting-the-ui-list-report-and-object-page-0d2f1a9.md).

In SAP Fiori elements for OData V4, app developers adapt the UI via manifest settings. You can search for features and navigate to the related documentation for further details using the [SAP Fiori Elements Feature Map](sap-fiori-elements-feature-map-62d3f7c.md).

## Key User Adaptation

Key users can adapt the application at runtime by changing the UI from the initial state of the app to a personalized view for end users. In the *User Actions Menu*, key users can then choose *Adapt UI* and change the user interface of SAP Fiori apps directly. For more information about what you have to consider when developing apps that support key user adaptation, see [SAPUI5 Flexibility: Enable Your App for UI Adaptation](../05_Developing_Apps/sapui5-flexibility-enable-your-app-for-ui-adaptation-f1430c0.md). For more information about key user adaptation, refer to [SAPUI5 Flexibility: Adapting UIs Made Easy](../04_Essentials/sapui5-flexibility-adapting-uis-made-easy-a8e55aa.md).

> ### Note:
