# The `FilterBar` Building Block

The `FilterBar` building block allows application developers to embed a filter bar in their application block.

> ### Sample Code:  
> `FilterBar` Building Block
> 
> ```
> <macros:FilterBar
>     metaPath="@com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.SelectionFields#SF1"
>     id="FilterBar"
>     search=".handlers.onSearch"
>     filtersChanged=".handlers.onFiltersChanged"
> />
> ```

Default values using `UI.SelectionVariant` and `Common.FilterDefaultValue` as well as custom filters are supported. Check out our live example in the flexible programming model explorer at [Filter Bar - Overview](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/fe/core/fpmExplorer/index.html#/buildingBlocks/filterBar/filterBarDefault).

For more information about custom filter fields, see [Adding Custom Fields to the Filter Bar](adding-custom-fields-to-the-filter-bar-5fb9f57.md).

> ### Note:  
> When using the `FilterBar` building block in a custom section or a custom subsection that deals with the navigation entity, make sure all the controls that need to be filtered by the filter bar are part of the same UI fragment as the `FilterBar` building block.

> ### Restriction:  
> The `FilterBar` building block has no provision to bring up the visual filter bar.

## Triggering Filter Search Programmatically

Applications can programmatically trigger the filter search on initial load using the `triggerSearch()` method. When called, it first validates that all the mandatory filter fields are filled out. The filter bar 'Go' is triggered only if all of them have valid values. If any of the mandatory filter fields aren't filled out, the focus is set to the first mandatory filter field that isn't filled. Note that in this case, the field won't be highlighted and no error messages will be sent to the user.

## Using the SelectionVariant Format

The following methods are available for interacting with the `FilterBar` building block using the `SelectionVariant` format:

-   `async getSelectionVariant () : Promise<SelectionVariant>`

-   `async setSelectionVariant (selectionVariant : SelectionVariant)`

> ### Restriction:  
> Custom filters are not part of the `getSelectionVariant` and `setSelectionVariant` APIs.
