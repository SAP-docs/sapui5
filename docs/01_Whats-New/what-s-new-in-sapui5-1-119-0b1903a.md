-   You can now use `sap.m.plugins.CellSelector` \(experimental\) for cell selection in a table. It can also be used for the `sap.ui.mdc.Table` control \(experimental\). For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.plugins.CellSelector). 

-   We have made the different row mode elements of the tables available. They replace the various properties \(now deprecated\) that used to define, for example, whether a fixed number of rows is displayed in a table, or whether the user can change the number of displayed rows. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.table.rowmodes) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.table.Table/sample/sap.ui.table.sample.RowModes).

For the `tokenHandling` parameter of the `v2.ODataModel`, we now support the additional `skipServerCache` string value. If you provide this value, the security token is not cached with the server as a key. This prevents failing `$batch` requests when accessing services running on different back-end systems behind a reverse proxy. Use this option only if the system landscape is known.

The new version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model introduces the following features:

-   **Experimental:** You can now move nodes in recursive hierarchies. This experimental feature must not be used in productive applications yet.

    For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context%23methods/move).

-   **Experimental:** The `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataContextBinding#execute` method can now also return a so-called return value context if the path of the binding parameter contains a navigation property. This experimental feature must not be used in productive applications yet.

    For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataContextBinding%23methods/execute).

-   We have updated the Adaptive type `sap.ui.integration.widgets.Card` to support the newest markdown features available for Microsoft Adaptive Cards. Тhe markdown third-party packages are now updated to version 12.3.2. For more information, see the [Adaptive Card](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/typesOther/adaptive) Learn section and [Markdown](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/adaptive/markdown) Samples in the Card Explorer.
-   Client-side pagination now provides access to the paginator model. Before, access was available only for server-side pagination. Card developers can now leverage the power of `skip`, `size`, and `pageIndex` model values to create more informative cards using data binding. For more information, see the [Pagination](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/features/pagination) Learn section and [Samples](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/pagination) in the Card Explorer.
-   The \(experimental\) `ShowCard` action is used to show another card with more details or additional actions. We have introduced two new \(experimental\) properties to control the card:
    -   `closeButton` - shows or hides a *Close* button in the header of the card. For more information, see the [Default Header](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/headers/default) and [Numeric Header](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/headers/numeric) Learn sections in the Card Explorer.
    -   `resizable` - controls whether the card can be resized. For more information, see the [Show Card](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/actions/showCard) Learn section in the Card Explorer.
