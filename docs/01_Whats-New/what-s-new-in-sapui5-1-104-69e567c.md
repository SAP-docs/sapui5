**Spreadsheet Export**

We have provided the following new features that are dependent on user information in the SAP Fiori launchpad:

-   Specific date and time formats, such as formats taken from calendars other than the Gregorian calendar and some related calendar settings, are now taken into account during the spreadsheet export.

-   You can now view information about the creation time and the relevant user in exported spreadsheets and PDF documents if you select *Include filter settings* in the *Export As* dialog.


For more information, see [Spreadsheet Export](../04_Essentials/spreadsheet-export-2691788.md) and the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.export.Spreadsheet/overview).

-   In the object page tables, you can now prepopulate the default empty rows with a value using `DefaultValuesFunction`.

**`sap.ui.integration.widgets.Card`**

-   We have \(experimentally\) enabled the possibility for a shared JavaScript library to be used as an extension by multiple cards. As a card developer, you can set this extension via the manifest. For more information, see the [Card Extension](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/features/extension) section and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/extension/sharedExtension) in the Card Explorer.

-   We have made the loading placeholders for Table and Object cards more detailed to better reveal the expected loading content. For more information, see the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.integration.widgets.Card/sample/sap.ui.integration.sample.LazyLoading).

-   We have \(experimentally\) introduced the possibility for ComboBox or TextArea form inputs to be used inside the Object card. Afterwards, you can process and submit the data provided with these form inputs to a back-end service. For more information, see the [Object Card](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/typesDeclarative/object) section and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/object/form) in the Card Explorer.

-   The Object card \(experimentally\) supports custom error message when there is empty data retrieved from the back end. To enable this feature, we have added a new `hasData` property inside the `content` section of the manifest. Card developers should set this property to point to a chosen data attribute. At runtime, if a condition is met, the corresponding illustrated message is displayed. For more information, see the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/errorMessages/object).
