Note that even though the `content` aggregation can be used for any control, complex responsive layout controls, such as `Table` and `Form`, should not be used.

**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model**

The new version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model introduces the following features:

-   The `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding.requestContexts` method is available for requesting and accessing a collection in controller code through list bindings.


> ### Restriction:  
> Due to the limited feature scope of this version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, check that all required features are in place before developing freestyle and SAP Fiori elements applications. Double-check the detailed documentation of the features, as certain parts of a feature may be missing. While we aim to be compatible with existing controls, some controls might not work due to small incompatibilities compared to `sap.ui.model.odata.(v2.)ODataModel`, or due to missing features in the model \(such as tree binding\). This also applies to smart controls \(`sap.ui.comp` library\) that do not support the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, as well as controls such as `TreeTable` and `AnalyticalTable`, which are not supported in combination with the SAPUI5 OData V4 model. The interface for applications has been changed for easier and more efficient use of the model. For a summary of these changes, see [Changes Compared to OData V2 Model](../04_Essentials/changes-compared-to-odata-v2-model-abd4d7c.md).

For more information, see [OData V4 Model](../04_Essentials/odata-v4-model-5de13cf.md), the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4), and the [Samples](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel).

When `showFooter` is set to `true`, the picker no longer closes when a day is selected and there's no need to reopen the picker to select the month or year.For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.DatePicker) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.m.DatePicker/sample/sap.m.sample.DatePicker).

-   We have introduced a new `clearButtonPressed` parameter for the `search` event of the control. The parameter is set to `true` when the *Clear* button of the search field is pressed.

-   We have introduced the `resizable` and `draggable` properties for the control. If the `resizable` property is set to `true`, `SelectDialog` has a resize handler in its bottom-right corner. If the `draggable` property is set to `true`, the control can be dragged by its header. Both properties are available in desktop mode only.

The `startHour` and `endHour` properties define the starting and ending hours of the working day, and these are indicated visually on the screen. The `fullDay` property contains a boolean flag, which determines whether nonworking hours are aslo displayed.For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.SinglePlanningCalendar) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.m.SinglePlanningCalendar/sample/sap.m.sample.SinglePlanningCalendarWithLegend).

Note that this behaviour comes out of the box without setting any properties.For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.unified.Calendar) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.unified.Calendar/sample/sap.ui.unified.sample.CalendarMultipleMonth).

**List Report and Object Page**

General features:

-   You can now use the `MultiSelectionPlugin` in tables. For more information, see [Enabling Multiple Selection in Tables](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/enabling-multiple-selection-in-tables-116b5d8.md).

    > ### Note:  
    > This feature results in new table selection behavior for multi-select enabled tables \(`GridTable`, `AnalyticalTable`, `TreeTable`\). Choosing the *Select All* checkbox for these tables resulted in performance issues. A real select all to the backend system was executed that, depending on the service, number of entries, hardware of the client device, and more aspects, took very long and sometimes resulted in a timeout. Therefore, the *Select All* checkbox is replaced by the *Deselect All* arrow with SAPUI5 1.69 for tables on list pages from the list report and analytical list page and with SAPUI5 1.70 for tables on any kind of SAP Fiori elements object page. The `selectAll` parameter was introduced to get the *Select All* checkbox back on the UI.

    **Deselect All Arrow**

    ![](images/MultiSelect_DeselectAll_449a6ae.jpg "Deselect All Arrow")


The object page has these new features:

-   In addition to the smart area micro chart and the smart bullet micro chart, you can now use the following micro charts within the object page header:

    -   Smart radial micro chart

    -   Smart column micro chart

    -   Smart line micro chart

    -   Smart harvey micro chart

    -   Smart stacked bar micro chart


    For more information, see [Micro Chart Facet](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/micro-chart-facet-e219fd0.md).

-   A *Paste* button is available in the table toolbar if copying and pasting from Microsoft Excel is supported. For more information, see [Copying and Pasting from External Applications to Tables](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/copying-and-pasting-from-external-applications-to-tables-f6a8fd2.md).


**Overview Page**

The overview page has these new features or enhancements:

-   The date fields are now right-aligned for table cards. For more information, see [Table Cards](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/table-cards-167bf7c.md).

-   The mandatory fields in the smart filter bar are now highlighted and an error message is displayed only after triggering the search by clicking Go. Previously, the error would be displayed without triggering the search.
