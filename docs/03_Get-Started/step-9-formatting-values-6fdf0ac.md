# Step 9: Formatting Values

We also want to provide our users a way of contacting Harry Hawk. Therefore we will add a link that sends an e-mail to Harry. To achieve that we will convert our data in the model to match the `sap.m.URLHelper.normalizeEmail` API. As soon as the user changes the name, the e-mail will also change. We will need a custom formatter function for this.

## Coding

You can view and download all files in the Demo Kit at [Data Binding - Step 9](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.core.tutorial.databinding/sample/sap.ui.core.tutorial.databinding.09).

1.  Create a new folder `controller` within your `webapp` folder as a general location for all controller files for this app and create a new file `App.controller.js` with the following content:

    **webapp/controller/App.controller.js \(New\)**

    ```js
    sap.ui.define([
    	"sap/m/library",
    	"sap/ui/core/mvc/Controller"
    ], (mobileLibrary, Controller) => {
    	"use strict";
    
    	return Controller.extend("ui5.databinding.controller.App", {
    		formatMail(sFirstName, sLastName) {
    			const oBundle = this.getView().getModel("i18n").getResourceBundle();
    
    			return mobileLibrary.URLHelper.normalizeEmail(
    				`${sFirstName}.${sLastName}@example.com`,
    				oBundle.getText("mailSubject", [sFirstName]),
    				oBundle.getText("mailBody"));
    		}
    	});
    });
    ```

    In our custom formatter, we define the first and last name that are currently in the model as function parameters. When a user changes the data in the model by entering a different name in the input fields, our formatter will be invoked automatically by the framework. This makes sure that the UI is in sync with the data model.

    In the `formatMail` function, we use the `sap.m.URLHelper.normalizeEmail` function that expects an e-mail address, a mail subject and a text body. When a user chooses the link, the default email client will open with these parameters.For more information, see [API Reference: `sap.m.URLHelper.normalizeEmail`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.URLHelper/methods/normalizeEmail). The `mailSubject` resource bundle text will contain a placeholder for the first name of the recipient \(see below\). Therefore, we provide the name with `[sFirstName]`.

    > ### Note:  
    > For a detailed description of the e-mail link format, see [https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Email\_links](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Email_links).

2.  Enhance the `App.view.xml` file as shown below:

    **webapp/view/App.view.xml**

    ```xml
    <mvc:View 
       controllerName="ui5.databinding.controller.App"
    ...
    <Panel headerText="{i18n>panel2HeaderText}" class="sapUiResponsiveMargin" width="auto">
    		<content>
    			<l:VerticalLayout>
    				<Label labelFor="address" text="{i18n>address}:"/>
    				<FormattedText class="sapUiSmallMarginBottom"
    					htmlText="{/address/street}&lt;br&gt;{/address/zip} {/address/city}&lt;br&gt;{/address/country}"
    					id="address" width="200px"/>
    				<Link href="{
    						parts: [
    							'/firstName',
    							'/lastName'
    						],
    						formatter: '.formatMail'
    					}"
    					text="{i18n>sendEmail}"/>
    			</l:VerticalLayout>
    		</content>
    	</Panel>
    </mvc:View>
    ```

    For more complex bindings we cannot use the simple binding syntax with the curly braces anymore. The `href` property of the `Link` element now contains an entire object inside the string value. In this case, the object has two properties:

    -   `parts`

        This is a JavaScript array in which each element is a string representing a `path` property. The number and order of the elements in this array corresponds directly to the number and order of parameters expected by the `formatMail` function.

    -   `formatter`

        A reference to the function that receives the parameters listed in the `parts` array. Whatever value is returned by the formatter function becomes the value set for the `href` property. The dot \(<code><b></b>formatMail</code>\) at the beginning of the formatter tells SAPUI5 to look for a `formatMail` function on the controller instance of the view. If you do not use the dot, the function will be resolved by looking into the global namespace.


    > ### Note:  
    > When using formatter functions, the binding is automatically switched to "one-way". So you can’t use a formatter function for "two-way" scenarios, but you can use data types \(which will be explained in the following steps\).

3.  Add the `# E-mail` section to the `i18n.properties` and `i18n_de.properties` files as shown below.

    **webapp/i18n/i18n.properties**

    ```ini
    …
    # Screen titles
    panel1HeaderText=Data Binding Basics 
    panel2HeaderText=Address Details
    
    # E-mail
    sendEmail=Send Mail
    mailSubject=Hi {0}!
    mailBody=How are you?
    ```

    **webapp/i18n/i18n\_de.properties**

    ```ini
    …
    # Screen titles
    panel1HeaderText=Data Binding Grundlagen
    panel2HeaderText=Adressdetails
    
    # E-mail
    sendEmail=E-mail versenden
    mailSubject=Hallo {0}!
    mailBody=Wie geht es dir?
    ```

On the other hand, data entered by the user has to be parsed and validated to be understood by the data source. For this purpose, you use formatters and data types.")
