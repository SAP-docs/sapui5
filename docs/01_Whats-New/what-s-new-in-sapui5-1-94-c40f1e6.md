**SAP Fiori Elements: Object Pages: Search Bar Added to Table Toolbar**

The following information concerns important upcoming changes. UI changes may have an impact on the user experience and may require test cases to be adapted.

Tables with searchable content in object pages now have a search field in the toolbar. The search behavior is the same as in list report filter bars. For more information, see [Tables](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/tables-c0f6592.md).

**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model**

The new version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model introduces the following features:

-   Bound transition messages can now also be received in the `sap-messages` header. This can be useful if the payload, and hence any messages within the payload, is not available, for example in a success response of an action or function without corresponding return type. In this case, the server can send a bound transition message in the `sap-messages` header that the OData V4 model can forward to the message model.

-   XML templating can now process the `@com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.DoNotCheckScaleOfMeasureQuantity` annotation. This annotation prevents the validation of the number of decimals.

-   A new `@$ui5.node.groupLevelCount` instance annotation for data aggregation scenarios. It represents the number of direct children of a group node. For more information, see [Data Aggregation and Recursive Hierarchy](../04_Essentials/data-aggregation-and-recursive-hierarchy-7d91431.md).

**`sap.ui.comp.smartfield.SmartField`**

The `SmartField` control now supports the `com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.DoNotCheckScaleOfMeasuredQuantity` annotation. When this annotation is added, the `SmartField` doesn't check whether the maximum number of decimal places for a unit of measure corresponds to what is determined in the code list customizing the currency codes and units. Skipping the validation of decimals allows the user to add more fractional digits than what's defined for the corresponding unit of measure. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.comp.smartfield.SmartField%23controlProperties).

For more information, see [Currency and Unit Customizing in OData V2](../04_Essentials/odata-v2-model-6c47b2b.md#loioaa9024c7c5444822a68daeb21a92bd51).

**SAP Fiori elements for OData V4**

The following changes and new features are available for SAP Fiori elements for OData V4:

-   The search field is now also available in the table toolbar on the object page. If the table is searchable \(that is, if an entity set is used for which `sap:searchable` is `true`\), the search field is displayed by default. For more information, see [Tables](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/tables-c0f6592.md).

-   When using multi-selection in tables, the *Select All* checkbox has been disabled by default in responsive tables in the list report, and on the object page in tab bar mode. End users can undo the selection using the *Clear All* checkbox. For more information, see [Enabling Multiple Selection in Tables](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/enabling-multiple-selection-in-tables-116b5d8.md).

-   Application developers can now display a field as a `TextArea` in edit mode or as an `ExpandableText` in display mode. For more information, see [Different Representations of a Field](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/different-representations-of-a-field-c18ada4.md).

-   App developers can now use fractional digits on visual filters. For more information, see [Visual Filters](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/visual-filters-1714720.md).

-   SAP Fiori elements for OData V4 now supports upload and delete functionalities for `Edm.stream` properties. For more information, see [Different Representations of a Field](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/different-representations-of-a-field-c18ada4.md).

-   SAP Fiori elements for OData V4 now supports the equal split mode for side content. For more information, see [Adding Dynamic Side Content to Object Page Sections](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/adding-dynamic-side-content-to-object-page-sections-8e01a46.md).

-   Application developers can now add actions for each form on the object page. For more information, see [Adding Custom Actions Using Extension Points](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/adding-custom-actions-using-extension-points-7619517.md) and [Adding Action Buttons to Forms in Sections](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/adding-action-buttons-to-forms-in-sections-e64efda.md).
