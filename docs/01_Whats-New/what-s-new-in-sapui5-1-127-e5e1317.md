To support time series for the chart, we have now implemented time dimensions. We have introduced the `timeUnitType` property for `PropertyInfo` to enable this feature. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.mdc.chart.PropertyInfo%23properties).

To validate `p13n`-relevant metadata in the application, we have implemented a consistency check that compares the result returned by the `fetchProperties` property of the delegate against the `propertyInfo` property. If the provided `propertyInfo` is not a subset of the result, an error is thrown. This check is implemented in all controls with a `propertyInfo` property and a `fetchProperties` callback in the related delegate.

**SAP Fiori Elements for OData V4** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

**SAP Fiori Elements for OData V4**

The following changes and new features are available for SAP Fiori elements for OData V4:

We've made performance improvements for side effect annotations related to action calls.

Previously, even when an action didn't have an annotated side effect, the full entity was read after executing the action. Now, if an action doesn't have a side effect annotation and the service supports state messages, the system implicitly reads the state messages. For performance optimization, SAP Fiori elements for OData V4 no longer fetches unnecessary data. As a result, it's possible that the required data for an action is no longer executed if you haven't annotated the corresponding side effect.

SAP Fiori elements for OData V4 always aims to read only the required data. If applications want data to be refreshed after a change made by a user, or by calling an action, they must define a side effect. With this change, SAP Fiori elements no longer implicitly reads the full instance after the execution of an action. Instead, SAP Fiori elements relies on the definition of side effects.

> ### Example:  
> Your app contains an action that results in a status change on the UI, such as the delivery status of an item changing from *Sent* to *Delivered*.
> 
> Until now the status changed automatically, because all app data was loaded. Now, if the UI requires any other side effects, you must ensure that a side effect annotation exists for the action.

**CSS Custom Properties for Theming of Custom Controls/Applications**

We have included the theming parameters from the SAP Theming Base Content as CSS custom properties in the Horizon and Quartz themes of SAPUI5. You can now use them in your CSS for your custom controls or applications. We have also extended the Theme Parameter Toolbox to display the CSS custom properties for the Horizon and Quartz themes by default. The previous experimental `xx-css-variables` configuration option is no longer available.

For more information, see [CSS Variables, Functions, and More](../04_Essentials/enhanced-theming-concepts-45df6df.md#loio45df6dff504647c686ab9ba72af827f6__section_CSS), [Theming](../04_Essentials/theming-497c27a.md), and [Theme Parameter Toolbox](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/m/demokit/theming/webapp/index.html).

**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model**

The new version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model introduces the following features:

-   We have improved the experimental `OneWay` binding support for property bindings for structural properties that have a complex type. Updates on the client are now properly reflected.

    For more information, see [Property Binding With an Object Value](../04_Essentials/initialization-and-read-requests-fccfb2e.md#loiofccfb2eb41414f0792c165e69a878717__section_PBOV).

-   We have added the experimental `iLevels` parameter to `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#expand`. Note that it must not be used in productive applications yet.

    For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context%23methods/expand).
