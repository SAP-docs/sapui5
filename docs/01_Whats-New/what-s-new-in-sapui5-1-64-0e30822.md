**`sap.f.Card`**

The new `sap.f.Card` control complies with the visual design of the Integration Card \(`sap.ui.integration.widgets.Card`\). In contrast to the Integration Card, `sap.f.Card` provides more freedom in choosing the structure and the controls you can include, so that you can compose the card content area according to your needs. It enables you to decide and compose the card content area according to your needs.

The `sap.f.Card` consists of three elements: a container with background color and rounded corners, a header, and content areas.

**Rule Builder: AST based DMN SFEEL**

The rule builder now supports a new expression language: AST based DMN SFEEL. DMN SFEEL is an improvised approach to modeling business decision logic. It can be used both in text rules as well as in decision tables.

For more information, see [Rule Builder Control Tutorial](../03_Get-Started/rule-builder-control-tutorial-67fcb30.md).

**Key User Adaptation: Restricting Adaptation for Certain Controls**

It is now possible to exclude certain controls from key user adaptation \(formerly known as **UI adaptation at runtime**\) by adding instance-specific design time metadata:

-   `not-removable` prevents controls from being removed.
-   `not-adaptable` prevents controls from being changed.

For more information, see [SAPUI5 Flexibility: Enable Your App for UI Adaptation](../05_Developing_Apps/sapui5-flexibility-enable-your-app-for-ui-adaptation-f1430c0.md).

**SAPUI5 Flexibility: New `flexEnabled` Flag**

The `flexEnabled` flag in the `sap.ui5` section of the `manifest.json` indicates whether the application supports key user adaptation and developer adaptation. If you set the flag, it's also possible to check via SAP Web IDE if your control IDs are stable.

**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model**

With the new version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, the number of decimal places of entered numbers is checked against the unit or the currency customizing when using the `sap.ui.model.odata.type.Unit` and `sap.ui.model.odata.type.Currency` types that were introduced with SAPUI5 1.63.

> ### Restriction:  
> Due to the limited feature scope of this version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, check that all required features are in place before developing applications. Check the detailed documentation of the features, as certain parts of a feature may be missing. While we aim to be compatible with existing controls, some controls might not work due to small incompatibilities compared to `sap.ui.model.odata.(v2.)ODataModel`, or due to missing features in the model \(such as tree binding\). This also applies to smart controls \(`sap.ui.comp` library\) and SAP Fiori elements that do not support the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, as well as controls such as `TreeTable` and `AnalyticalTable`, which are not supported together with the SAPUI5 OData V4 model. The interface for applications has been changed for easier and more efficient use of the model. For a summary of these changes, see [Changes Compared to OData V2 Model](../04_Essentials/changes-compared-to-odata-v2-model-abd4d7c.md).

For more information, see [OData V4 Model](../04_Essentials/odata-v4-model-5de13cf.md), the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4), and the [Samples](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel).

We have redesigned the content area of the `DynamicPageTitle` control so that the width of the `expandedContent` and `snappedContent` aggregations no longer depends on the width of the `heading` aggregation. Both `expandedContent` and `snappedContent` aggregations can now take the whole width of the `DynamicPageTitle` and are displayed below the heading and content areas.For more information, see the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.f.DynamicPage/sample/sap.f.sample.DynamicPageFreeStyle).

**`sap.f.ShellBar` \(Experimental\)**

We have implemented an additional element that visualizes the number of notifications for the app \(`notificationsNumber` property\). It is displayed at the top right corner of the notifications button. When the resize breakpoint is hit and the notifications button enters the overflow area of the `OverflowToolbar`, the element is displayed at the top right corner of both the `OverflowToolbarButton` and the overflow area notification button.

**`sap.m.ComboBox`** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

**`sap.m.ComboBox`**

We have introduced grouping in the suggestions list of `sap.m.ComboBox`. This feature allows you to group items by certain characteristics, and to display a header. New group can be created in two ways:

-   If data binding is used, grouping is defined on the sorter in data binding.
-   Alternatively, you can add a group header programmatically as an instance of `sap.ui.core.SeparatorItem` with a text property by adding it to the items aggregation of the `sap.m.ComboBox` control. This transforms the `sap.ui.core.SeparatorItem` internally to `sap.m.GroupHeaderListItem`, and uses the text value as the header of the group.

In case a `sap.ui.core.SeparatorItem` without a defined text property is inserted in the aggregation items, the ComboBox will display only a horizontal separator without any text.For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.ComboBox) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.m.ComboBox/sample/sap.m.sample.ComboBoxGrouping).
