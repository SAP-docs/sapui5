**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model**

The new version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model introduces the following features:

-   New events `createSent` and `createCompleted` on `v4.ODataListBinding`: These events are sent when a POST request for creating an entity is sent to the backend, and when it is completed. Note that the created promise of the new context is only resolved when the POST was successful.

-   `bAtEnd` parameter for the `v4.ODataListBinding.create` method: If this parameter is set, the new entity is added at the end of the list. Note that you must determine the length of the list using `$count`.

-   Format option `emptyString` defaults to 0 for `odata.type.Currency` and `odata.type.Unit`.

-   `v4.Context.requestSideEffects` can also be called on a context of a list binding representing a single entity and the header context of a list binding. For the latter, side effects are loaded for the whole binding.

-   Processing the ETag from the response header.


> ### Restriction:  
> Due to the limited feature scope of this version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, check that all required features are in place before developing applications. Check the detailed documentation of the features, as certain parts of a feature may be missing. While we aim to be compatible with existing controls, some controls might not work due to small incompatibilities compared to `sap.ui.model.odata.(v2.)ODataModel`, or due to missing features in the model \(such as tree binding\). This also applies to smart controls \(`sap.ui.comp` library\) and SAP Fiori elements that do not support the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, as well as controls such as `TreeTable` and `AnalyticalTable`, which are not supported together with the SAPUI5 OData V4 model. The interface for applications has been changed for easier and more efficient use of the model. For a summary of these changes, see [Changes Compared to OData V2 Model](../04_Essentials/changes-compared-to-odata-v2-model-abd4d7c.md).

For more information, see [OData V4 Model](../04_Essentials/odata-v4-model-5de13cf.md), the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4), and the [Samples](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel).

**`sap.suite.ui.commons.imageeditor`**

The new `ImageEditor` control enables your users to edit images right inside your applications. It allows your users to resize images to preset or custom dimensions, crop images to rectangular, circular, or oval shapes, rotate and flip images, and apply widely used filters and effects. Available filters and effects include: brightness, contrast, saturation, grayscale, sepia, and invert colors.

The control's functionality is also exposed through an API and can be triggered programmatically.

For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.suite.ui.commons.imageeditor) and the [samples](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.suite.ui.commons.imageeditor).

**`sap.f.GridContainer` \(Experimental\)** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

**`sap.f.GridContainer` \(Experimental\)**

We have introduced three new properties:

-   `containerQuery` allows you to derive the layout breakpoints either based on the container surrounding the `sap.f.GridContainer` or the device screen size.

-   `allowDenseFill` is an experimental property that allows you to try out a denser arrangement of the grid items. Smaller items will take up all the available space, ignoring their order.

-   `inlineBlockLayout` is an experimental property. It allows you to arrange the items in rows with the height equal to the highest item in the row.


For more information, see [sap.f.GridContainer](../10_More_About_Controls/sap-f-gridcontainer-cca5ee5.md) and the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.f.GridContainer).

The options list used in these controls is now instantiated lazily. The list is created primarily based on user interaction. As a result of the change, the initialization time of the controls has decreased significantly.

-   [PgUp\]/[PgDn\] - increments/decrements the date

-   [Shift\] + [PgUp\] /[Shift\] + [PgDn\]  - increments/decrements the month

-   [Ctrl\] + [Shift\] + [PgUp\] /[Ctrl\] + [Shift\] + [PgDn\]  - increments/decrements the year

-   You can now include custom views to display different numbers of columns in the grid area of the control, for example, you can show only the first 10 days of each month. To create custom views, extend the `sap.m.SinglePlanningCalendarView` basic view class.For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.SinglePlanningCalendar) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.m.SinglePlanningCalendar/sample/sap.m.sample.SinglePlanningCalendarWithCustomViews).

-   We have implemented a new `specialDates` aggregation, that allows you to define special dates for the control. They are visualized as a color bar in the header below the respective dates. In addition, you can add the assigned special dates to the associated `sap.m.PlanningCalendarLegend`.For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.SinglePlanningCalendar) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.m.SinglePlanningCalendar/sample/sap.m.sample.SinglePlanningCalendarWithLegend).

-   We added an arrow indicator to improve the visual design of appointments which are not marked as *All-day* but do continue outside of the visible area.
