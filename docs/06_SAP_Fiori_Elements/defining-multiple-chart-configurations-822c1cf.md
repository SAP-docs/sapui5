# Defining Multiple Chart Configurations

You can define multiple chart configurations for the same dataset.

This feature enables you to display different charts for different use cases, based on the same dataset. Use the chart configurations to do the following:

-   Display different charts in different views of the list report.

-   Display different charts in different sections of the object page.


To define multiple chart configurations on the same entity, define a `UI.Chart` annotation with a specific qualifier.

For more information and live examples, see the SAP Fiori development portal at [Building Blocks - Chart - Usage with Qualifier](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/fe/core/fpmExplorer/index.html#/buildingBlocks/chart/chartQualifier).
