# Cache Behavior for Application Resources

By default, the application files are stored in the browser cache for one year to speed up the performance of an SAPUI5 app in a productive environment.

To get the latest changes, you need to force your SAPUI5 start page to refresh, for example, with [CTRL\] + [F5\]  on Windows systems. If the refresh doesn't work, clear your browser cache.
