# Further Extensions

We recommend using [Extension Points](extension-points-403c050.md) and [Controller Extensions](controller-extensions-21515f0.md) as the preferred standard approaches to customize applications. Consider the mechanisms below only in the following cases:

-   You need a specialized extension that toggles the visibility of controls in your custom application.
-   You need to make fundamental changes to your view or your controller's behavior, and the standard extension mechanisms aren't sufficient.
