# if

The `<template:if>` instruction evaluates a condition expressed via existing SAPUI5 data binding features, such as extended syntax; in the preprocessing it is removed or replaced by its child elements based on the value of this condition.

For more information, see [Sorting, Grouping, and Filtering for List Binding](sorting-grouping-and-filtering-for-list-binding-ec79a5d.md).

You set the condition to the `test` attribute of the `if` instruction. It is recommended to use expression binding if you need to write logical expressions or convert values into Booleans. You can also use formatter functions, as with any SAPUI5 binding, such as `sap.ui.model.odata.AnnotationHelper.isMultiple`. For more information, see `sap.ui.model.odata.AnnotationHelper.isMultiple` in the API Reference.

> ### Note:  
> The test condition is treated as a property binding and the result is converted to the Boolean type according to the usual JavaScript rules, with the exception of the string `"false"`, which is converted to the Boolean `false` for convenience. For more information about the JavaScript rules, see the ECMAScript® Language Specification on the [ECMA International](http://www.ecma-international.org/) website.



## "if" Instruction to Include an Image Only if the URL is Set

The output of the template below after preprocessing is as follows: If the test condition does not hold, the `<template:if>` node is dropped and if the test condition holds, the node is replaced by its content.

```xml
<template:if test="{meta>ImageUrl}">
  <Image src="{path: 'meta>ImageUrl', formatter: 'sap.ui.model.odata.AnnotationHelper.format'}" />
</template:if>
```

> ### Note:  
> The example above shows a shortcut syntax where `<template:then>` can be omitted in case no `<template:else>` is present.



## "if/then/else" Instruction to Include an Image Only if the URL is Set and Display a Title Otherwise

The syntax of this example is more complex due to the additional `<template:then>`/`<template:else>` elements. The output is the `<template:if>` node replaced by the content of the appropriate child node.

> ### Sample Code:  
> ```xml
> <template:if test="{meta>ImageUrl}">
>   <template:then>
>     <Image src="{path: 'meta>ImageUrl', formatter: 'sap.ui.model.odata.AnnotationHelper.format'}" />
>   </template:then>
>   <template:else>
>     <Text text="{path: 'meta>Title/Value', formatter: 'sap.ui.model.odata.AnnotationHelper.format'}" />
>   </template:else>
> </template:if>
> ```



## if/then/else Instruction

It is even possible to check multiple conditions in one `<template:if>` construct using the `<template:elseif>` element as shown in the example below.

```xml
<template:if test="{meta>ImageUrl}">
  <template:then>
    <m:Image src="{path: 'meta>ImageUrl', formatter: 'sap.ui.model.odata.AnnotationHelper.format'}" />
  </template:then>
  <template:elseif test="{meta>TypeImageUrl}">
    <commons:Image src="{path: 'meta>TypeImageUrl', formatter: 'sap.ui.model.odata.AnnotationHelper.format'}" />
  </template:elseif>
  <template:else>
    <commons:Text text="{path: 'meta>Title/Value', formatter: 'sap.ui.model.odata.AnnotationHelper.format'}" />
  </template:else>
</template:if>
```
