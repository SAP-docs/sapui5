**Support for Persian Calendar**

All our controls now support the Persian calendar. The Persian calendar is also sometimes referred to as "Solar Hijri", "Iranian" or "Farsi" calendar.

The Persian calendar year begins around March 21st of each Gregorian year and ends at around March 20th of the following year. To convert the Persian calendar years into the equivalent Gregorian year, add 621 or 622 years to the Persian calendar year depending on whether the Persian calendar year has begun or not.

**`sap.f.Avatar`**

**`sap.f.Avatar`** is an SAP Fiori 2.0 image-like control that has different display options for representing images, initials, and icons. It allows the usage of different content, shapes, and sizes depending on the use case.

![](images/WhatsNew_146_Avatar1_b6de75d.png)

There are several predefined sizes, as well as an option to set a custom size.

<td valign="top">

**`sap.f.FlexibleColumnLayout`**

This control represents the new SAP Fiori 2.0 base layout for an app. It implements the master-detail-detail paradigm by displaying up to three pages in separate columns. The columns are referred to as `Begin`, `Mid`, and `End`, and their width is variable depending on the current layout.

There are several possible layouts that can be changed with the control's API, and also by the user with navigation arrows.

![](images/WhatsNew_146_FlexibleColumnLayout_2d2dc78.png)

For more information, see [Building an App with the Flexible Column Layout and Related Classes](../10_More_About_Controls/building-an-app-with-the-flexible-column-layout-and-related-classes-59a0e11.md), the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.f.FlexibleColumnLayout), and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.f.FlexibleColumnLayout/sample/sap.f.sample.FlexibleColumnLayoutSimple).

**`sap.f.semantic.SemanticPage`**

This new SAP Fiori 2.0 control represents an enhanced `sap.f.DynamicPage` that contains controls with semantic-specific meaning. You can set different actions using the available aggregations, and the `sap.f.semantic.SemanticPage` will automatically position them in dedicated sections of the title or the footer of the page, facilitating the implementation of the SAP Fiori 2.0 design guidelines.

**`sap.suite.ui.microchcart` library**

The following new, interactive charts are available and have been designed especially for analytical applications:

-   The `sap.suite.ui.microchcart.InteractiveDonutChart` control visualizes the data \(only positive values\) as segments of a donut and provides the corresponding details as a legend in the control. You can interact with both the legend and the donut for selection actions that are synchronized between the legend and the donut.

    ![](images/WhatsNew_146_Interactive_Donut_6b80911.png)

    For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.suite.ui.microchart.InteractiveDonutChart) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.suite.ui.microchart.InteractiveDonutChart/sample/sap.suite.ui.microchart.sample.InteractiveDonutChart).

-   The `sap.suite.ui.microchcart.InteractiveBarChart` control visualizes the data as horizontal bars upon which the user can interact for actions based on the selection. The data can be displayed as a positive or negative value with a divider for separating these values.

    ![](images/WhatsNew_146_Interactive_Bar_Chart_a25b069.png)

    For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.suite.ui.microchart.InteractiveBarChart) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.suite.ui.microchart.InteractiveBarChart/sample/sap.suite.ui.microchart.sample.InteractiveBarChart).

-   The `sap.suite.ui.microchcart.InteractiveLineChart` control visualizes the data with connected points of a continuous set of dates or events with which the user can interact and trigger selection actions. The data can be displayed as a positive or negative value or both. The divider for separating these values changes respective to the values.

    ![](images/WhatsNew_146_Interactive_Line_Chart_527460b.png)

**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model**

The new version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model now supports the following features:

-   Changing query options on `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding` and `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataContextBinding`

-   Requesting `$count` system query option on `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding`

-   Accessing value lists

-   Forwarding the `$search` system query option

-   Branching from OData V4 model into metadata using the hash \(`#`\) character \(see [sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context\#getObject\(\)](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel/methods/createBindingContext)\) in `template:with`


> ### Caution:  
> **Incompatibility Due to Bug Fix**
> 
> The following bug has been reported: If you call the [sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context\#getObject\(\)](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context/methods/getObject) or the [sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context\#requestObject\(\)](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context/methods/requestObject) methods without a parameter, the expected and documented behavior is that the same result is returned as if the parameter `sPath=""` had been specified. Due to the bug, however, the return value wraps the expected output that can then only be accessed via `.value[0]`, for example `oContext.getObject().value[0]`.
> 
> **If you have used this workaround, your application will break starting with SAPUI5 version 1.44.7.**
> 
> **Solution**: If your application needs to run with both the fixed and unfixed versions of SAPUI5, specify the `sPath=""` parameter, for `sPath` parameter. In both cases, you **must not** use the workaround with `.value[0]` any longer.

> ### Restriction:  
> Due to the limited feature scope of this version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, check that all required features are in place before developing applications. Check the detailed documentation of the features, as certain parts of a feature may be missing. While we aim to be compatible with existing controls, some controls might not work due to small incompatibilities compared to `sap.ui.model.odata.(v2.)ODataModel`, or due to missing features in the model \(such as tree binding\). This also applies to Smart Controls \(`sap.ui.comp` library\) and SAP Fiori Elements that do not support the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, as well as controls such as `TreeTable` and `AnalyticalTable`, which are not supported together with the SAPUI5 OData V4 model. The interface for applications has been changed for easier and more efficient use of the model. For a summary of these changes, see [Changes Compared to OData V2 Model](../04_Essentials/changes-compared-to-odata-v2-model-abd4d7c.md).

For more information, see [OData V4 Model](../04_Essentials/odata-v4-model-5de13cf.md), the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4), and the [sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel).

-   **Zoom Strategies Enhanced**: The zoom strategies have been enhanced to allow for flexible zooming control. The interface includes a base class of `AxisTimeStrategyBase` and three default implementations. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.gantt.axistime.AxisTimeStrategyBase) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.gantt.GanttChartContainer/sample/sap.gantt.sample.BasicGanttChart).

**SAP Fiori Elements** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

**SAP Fiori Elements**

**List Report and Object Page**

General Features:

-   Direct links from fields

    Using the `DataFieldWithIntentBasedNavigation` annotation, fields can now link directly to a specific action of a semantic object instead of using the smart link popup. For more information, see [Configuring External Navigation](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/configuring-external-navigation-1d4a0f9.md).

-   Navigation targets

    Table toolbar actions for intent-based navigation are now displayed or hidden based on the availability of the navigation target on the current platform.

-   Navigation at row level

    In grid and analytical tables, users can now navigate to the object page, at row level. The *Show Detail* button has been removed for these tables. For more information, see [Tables](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/tables-c0f6592.md).


Object Page View:

-   Performance optimization for side effects

    Previously, if no side effect annotation was specified, the whole object page was refreshed upon a change. Now, if there is no side effect annotation, the page is not refreshed automatically. This system behavior optimizes performance. For backward compatibility reasons, you have to enable the new system behavior in the application descriptor. For more information, see [Using Global Side Effects](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/using-global-side-effects-955ae31.md).

-   Form actions

    You can now add form actions to toolbars in object page facets. The following actions are supported:

    -   `DateFieldForActions`

    -   `DateFieldForIntentBasedNavigation`

    -   Custom actions using an extension point


    For more information, see [Adding Action Buttons to Forms in Sections](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/adding-action-buttons-to-forms-in-sections-e64efda.md) and [Adding Custom Actions Using Extension Points](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/adding-custom-actions-using-extension-points-7619517.md).

-   Contact information

    Quickviews with contact details can now also be displayed in forms and tables. For more information, see [Form Facet](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/form-facet-ff0ae0b.md).

-   Create and edit mode usability

    In create and edit draft mode, subitem object pages contain an *Apply* action in the footer. This action concludes the current create or edit activity, saves the draft, and navigates one step up in the object hierarchy. For more information, see [Draft Handling](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/draft-handling-ed9aa41.md).


List Report View:

-   Tree table

    You can now use tree tables in the list report page. Note that you can use this table type only in apps for ready-only scenarios. For more information, see [Tables](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/tables-c0f6592.md).


**Overview Pages \(OVP\)**

Overview pages have been enhanced with the following features:

-   **Custom Breakout Filters**

    You can now use custom breakout filters to add custom filters of your choice. You can also define custom controls for implementing custom filters. For more information, see [Configuring the Global Filter](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/configuring-the-global-filter-73d9693.md).

-   **Passing Sorting Parameters from OVP to an SAP Fiori Elements App**

    You can now pass sort order parameters when you navigate from OVP to an external SAP Fiori elements application. For more information, see [Configuring Sort Properties](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/configuring-sort-properties-41af842.md).

-   **Link List Card Enhancement**

    The *Link List* card has been enhanced to align with other overview page cards. It now supports qualifiers in annotations and global filter usage for dynamic data. For more information, see [Link List Cards](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/link-list-cards-0326f91.md).

-   **UI Enhancements**

    -   Page loading error messages overlay the entire overview page and appear as a full page message.

    -   The smart filter bar is aligned to match the width of cards.

    -   The content area in list cards and bar chart list cards is now flexible and responsive.

    -   The text area truncates based on the length of the values.

    -   Support for Belize theme for overview page applications. Using the SAP UI theme designer you can customize your application styles.
