**Harmonized Context Menu in Key User Adaptation**

The context menu is now consistent when you select elements. It no longer depends on how you select an element, such as using the left or right mouse button. The familiar right-click context menu now also appears when you left-click an element.

**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model**

The new version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model introduces the following features:

-   We have added the experimental `$$separate` binding parameter to `ODataListBinding`, which allows you to load properties with a longer loading time in a separate request. At the moment, only navigation properties can be specified in `$$separate`. Note that this parameter must not be used in productive applications yet.

-   We now support filtering by aggregated properties. For more information, see [Filtering](../04_Essentials/data-aggregation-and-recursive-hierarchy-7d91431.md#loio7d914317c0b64c23824bf932cc8a4ae1__section_DAF).

We now provide the `sap.ui.model.odata.ODataMetaModel#getFunctionImportParameterContext` method, which provides the parameter context for `sap.ui.model.odata.ODataMetaModel#getODataValueLists`. This enables the lazy loading of value list metadata of function import parameters.

For more information, see the API Reference for [`ODataMetaModel#getFunctionImportParameterContext`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.ODataMetaModel%23methods/getFunctionImportParameterContext) and [`ODataMetaModel#getODataValueLists`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.ODataMetaModel%23methods/getODataValueLists).

We've introduced the following features to the `SlideTile` control:

-   Added left and right chevrons to easily scroll the tiles in either direction.

-   Increased the slide indicator size to 24px to enable easier tapping on touchscreen devices.

-   Play and pause indicators are now displayed by default. Until now, these indicators were displayed only when a user hovered on the tile.

**`sap.suite.ui.commons.ChartContainer`**

We've introduced the `enableBrowserFullScreen` property in the `ChartContainer` control. This property enables the display of the content within the `ChartContainer` using the browser's fullscreen APIs. In fullscreen mode, `sap.m.Dialog`, `sap.m.Popover`, `sap.m.ResponsivePopover`, and `sap.m.SelectionDetails` can be displayed over the `ChartContainer` control. To enable the display, the controls are added as dependents of the `ChartContainer`.

> ### Sample Code:  
> An example of connecting a dialog to the `ChartContainer` control:
> 
> ```
> oChartContainer.addDependent(new Dialog({
>     text: "Display Dialog"
> }));
> ```

It allows the connected model to not only manage the insertion and deletion updates but it also helps to avoid template-related issues and ensures better data handling.

-   We have adapted and tidied up the structure of the context menu of group headers \(for example, we have added submenus\). In addition, the mobile menu button for group headers has been removed.

-   We have tidied up the interactive row count mode and the related entities: We have aligned the visual design of the resizer with the `sap.ui.layout.Splitter` control and improved the interaction, for example, the auto-resize and some missing keyboard shortcuts. We have also added the `maxRowCount` property with a default value. To improve accessibility, we have also added ARIA roles and attributes. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.table.rowmodes.Interactive%23overview) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.table.Table/sample/sap.ui.table.sample.RowModes).
