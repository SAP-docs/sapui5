    > ### Note:  
    > When you choose a custom location, keep in mind that the URL should match the protocol of the application. For example, if the application is HTTP, the location should also be HTTP. If it is HTTPS, the location should be HTTPS. The URL should also end in `sap/ui/support/`.

    -   Under *Options* you can select if the Support Assistant should be opened in a separate window.

        > ### Note:  
        > Additional window popups may be blocked by your browser settings.


4.  Select *Activate Support Assistant*.

    Your application will reload and the Support Assistant will start.

    In the following diagram, you can see how the different SAPUI5 versions interact with the Support Assistant.
