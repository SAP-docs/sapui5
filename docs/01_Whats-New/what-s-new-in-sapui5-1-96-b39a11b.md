<td valign="top">

**Enabling Apps to Comply with a Content Security Policy \(CSP\) without `eval()` and Inline Styles**

The SAPUI5 framework now allows you to run applications in environments with stricter CSPs. Large parts of SAPUI5 don't require `eval()` or similar functions, as well as inline styles, any longer. For details about the supported policies as well as recommendations on writing CSP-compliant applications, see [Content Security Policy](../05_Developing_Apps/content-security-policy-fe1a6db.md).

> ### Note:  
> To run in a CSP-enabled environment, your apps need to be prepared for the policy used. See [Content Security Policy](../05_Developing_Apps/content-security-policy-fe1a6db.md).

**New Theme Available for SAP Fiori User Experience \(Experimental\)**

We have introduced a new theme, the preview version of the *Horizon* visual theme for SAP Fiori \(theme ID: `sap_horizon`\), as an addition to the existing themes. To preview the new theme, see [https://ui5.sap.com/?sap-ui-theme=sap\_horizon\#/controls](https://ui5.sap.com/?sap-ui-theme=sap_horizon#/controls) .

> ### Note:  
> The theme has the status 'experimental' and is thus subject to change. It must not be used as a basis for custom themes as long as the status is 'experimental'.

## Improved Features


<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**SAPUI5 Models**

We have provided the new `sap.ui.model.ListBinding#getFilters` method. It is available in all list bindings inheriting from `sap.ui.model.ListBinding`, for example in `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding` and `sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataListBinding`. We also provide getters for `sap.ui.model.Filter`.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**SAPUI5 OData V2 Model**

We have introduced the new `sap.ui.model.odata.v2.Context#created` method. For created records, the method returns a promise that resolves when the record is created in the back end. The promise is rejected if the record is deleted before being persisted in the back end.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model**

The new version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model introduces the following features:

-   You can now specify `$select` in addition to the `$$inheritExpandSelect` binding parameter of an [operation binding](../04_Essentials/odata-operations-b54f789.md).

-   We have complemented the [OData V4 tutorial](../03_Get-Started/odata-v4-bcdbde6.md) with additional chapters showing how to reuse data in a list-detail scenario.

-   You can now use [`Common.ValueListWithFixedValues`](https://github.com/SAP/odata-vocabularies/blob/main/vocabularies/Common.xml#L672:~:text=%3CTerm%20Name=%22-,ValueListWithFixedValues,-%22) in combination with [`Common.ValueListRelevantQualifiers`](https://github.com/SAP/odata-vocabularies/blob/main/vocabularies/Common.xml#L666:~:text=%3CTerm%20Name=%22-,ValueListRelevantQualifiers,-%22) if only one value list qualifier is relevant at a time. The `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataMetaModel#requestValueListInfo` method returns the relevant value list for the `""` qualifier and provides the original qualifier as the `$qualifier` property of the value list mapping.

## Improved Controls


<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**`sap.m.MaskInput`**

We have introduced the `showClearIcon` property. If set to `true`, when there is text input it shows an additional icon that allows users to clear their input. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.MaskInput).



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**`sap.m.MultiComboBox`**

We have implemented a checkbox that allows users to select all options, placed on top of the suggestions pop-up in the `sap.m.MultiComboBox` control. You can enable it using the `showSelectAll` property. The checkbox gives users the possibility to easily select/deselect all options, also when filtering them. For more information, see the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.m.MultiComboBox/sample/sap.m.sample.MultiComboBoxSelectAll). 



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**`sap.ui.comp.smartfield.SmartField`**

-   `SmartField` now shows by default multiple consecutive whitespace characters for string-based properties in display mode. Until now, the browser was merging whitespace characters into one single whitespace instead of displaying the original string. For more information, see [Whitespaces Concept](../05_Developing_Apps/whitespaces-concept-37deb0b.md). 

-   `SmartField` now supports the `Common.ValueListRelevantQualifiers` annotation. This annotation can limit the number of value list qualifiers based on a specific context determined by a property different from the annotated property. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.comp.smartfield.SmartField%23annotations/ValueListRelevantQualifiers) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.comp.smartfield.SmartField/sample/sap.ui.comp.sample.smartfield.ContextDependentValueHelp).




</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**`sap.ui.comp.smarttable.SmartTable`**

We have provided an option to disable the *Paste* button and control the related `Paste` event using the `enablePaste` property. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.comp.smarttable.SmartTable%23methods/getEnablePaste).



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**`sap.ui.integration.widgets.Card`**

-   The List and Table cards now allow their content items to be grouped. You can use the new `group` manifest extension to configure the titles of the groups and the order of the items in these groups. For more information, see the [List Card](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/types/list) section and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/list/grouping) in the Card Explorer.

-   List cards now support attributes on an item level. They can show up to six attributes of their itemsâ€™ attributes, which are displayed in one or two columns. For more information, see the [List Card](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/types/list) section and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/list/attributes) in the Card Explorer.

-   We have added a new `configurationChange` event, which is fired when some configuration settings are changed as a result of user interaction \(for example - filter change\). For more information, see the [Integration Cards API](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/integrate/api) section and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/configurationChanges) in the Card Explorer.

-   We have introduced a new `sideIndicatorsAlignment` property to the `sap.f.cards.NumericHeader`. This property controls the alignment of the side indicators in the numeric header. It can have two values `Begin` \(default\) or `End`. For more information, see the [Numeric Header](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/headers/numeric) section in the Card Explorer.

## SAP Fiori Elements


<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

The following changes and new features are available for SAP Fiori elements for OData V4 and SAP Fiori elements for OData V2:

-   You can now create a global filter bar using the SAP Fiori elements for OData V4 service for an overview page application. Use the filter bar to create a filter. An automatic switch occurs to the filter bar when the `globalFilterModel` is defined as OData V4 model. Currently, filtering on the cards, variant management, and value list annotation is supported.




</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

The following changes and new features are available for SAP Fiori elements for OData V2:

-   The object page header is now collapsed to a summary line when you scroll it on small screen devices. This optimizes the content view.

-   In the worklist applications, the options to sort, group, and filter are now available within the table personalization dialog that is consistent with the list report. For more information, see [Worklist](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/worklist-d1d588f.md).
