## Overview

The calculation builder control enables you to perform arithmetic calculations on literals and variables, using standard arithmetic operators and most common logical operators and functions. You can customize the sets of variables and functions that are visible in the calculation builder and introduce your own custom functions. Arithmetic expressions can be entered using a touch-friendly visual editor or a textual editor that provides autocomplete suggestions for variables and checks the expression syntax as you type.
