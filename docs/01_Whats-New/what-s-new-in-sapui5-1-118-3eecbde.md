**`sap.ui.comp.smarttable.SmartTable`**

-   We now evaluate the `com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.IsTimezone` annotation for the `SmartTable` control. The translated time zone is diplayed rather than the IANA ID. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.comp.smarttable.SmartTable%23annotations/IsTimezone) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.comp.smarttable.SmartTable/sample/sap.ui.comp.sample.smarttable).

-   You can now use quick grouping and quick sorting with multiple properties \(for example, ID and description of a supplier\) in the column header menu of responsive tables. For more information, see the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.comp.smarttable.SmartTable/sample/sap.ui.comp.sample.smarttable.smartMTableWithCriticality).

    The following annotations are now supported:

    -   `com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.IsCalendarYear`

    -   `com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.IsCalendarWeek`

-   We've replaced a key that application developers can override using the custom i18n file approach. If you're using the `T_ANNOTATION_HELPER_DEFAULT_OBJECT_PAGE_HEADER_TITLE_NO_HEADER_INFO` key in the application resource bundle, replace it with the new key.

**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model**

The new version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model introduces the following features:

-   **Experimental:** You can now create and delete nodes in recursive hierarchies. Note that these experimental features must not be used in productive applications yet.

    For more information, see the API Reference for [`ODataListBinding#create`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding%23methods/create) and [`Context#delete`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context%23methods/delete).

-   We now support the provision of a nested single entity in a transient entity.

    For more information, see *Nested Single Entity* in [Deep Create](../04_Essentials/creating-an-entity-c9723f8.md#loioc9723f8265f644af91c0ed941e114d46__section_DCR).

-   The control now supports smart links in semantically connected fields in a smart form. In display mode, individual smart links are offered for each relevant field of the semantically connected fields.

-   We have enabled the control to support the usage of analytical parameters in the value help dialog. Analytical parameters are values that are passed to the back end and that influences the way the back end processes the incoming request. Typically, those parameters are used to normalize entries that have different units of measure.

To improve accessibility, we have completely reworked the screen reader support and keyboard handling of the `sap.m.Table` control. The row-based navigation stays the same, but cell-based navigation is now also possible, similar to the grid table. We have also improved other accessibility features of the table, for example, the *Delete* and *Edit* buttons for row actions have become accessible via keyboard. These features have not only been changed for the responsive table, but partly also for `sap.m.List`. Also, the ARIA role has been adapted. We have adapted the related documentation.
