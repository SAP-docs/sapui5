## UI5 CLI

[UI5 CLI](https://ui5.github.io/cli/) is an open and modular toolchain to develop state-of-the-art SAPUI5 applications.

Follow these steps to start your UI5 journey with UI5 CLI:

1.  Install the latest LTS version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

2.  Open a new terminal and execute `npm i -g @ui5/cli`
