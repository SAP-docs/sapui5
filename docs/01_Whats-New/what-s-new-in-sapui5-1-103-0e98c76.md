**`sap.m.plugins.DataStateIndicator`**

The `MessageStrip` control, which is offered by the `DataStateIndicator` plugin, provides various messages for users that tell them about the current state of the UI. The new `close` event of `DataStateIndicator` is fired when the *Close* button of the `MessageStrip` control is pressed. This allows applications to intervene, for example, and let users remove these messages from the UI. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.plugins.DataStateIndicator%23events/close) for `DataStateIndicator`, the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.MessageStrip%23events/close) for `MessageStrip`, and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.comp.smarttable.SmartTable/sample/sap.ui.comp.sample.smarttable.mtableDataState).

We have made the UI for `SmartLink` more consistent with other UIs. We now use the `sap.m.Dialog` instead of the deprecated `sap.m.P13nDialog`. The dialog has been slightly changed: For example, the *Reset* button is now located in the upper right-hand corner. For more information, see the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.comp.tutorial.smartControls/sample/sap.ui.comp.tutorial.smartControls.03).

**`sap.ui.integration.widgets.Card`**

-   Colors in the `StackedBar` microcharts in List cards no longer accept `sap.m.ValueCSSColor` values. Now the colors should have standard semantic values provided by the `sap.m.ValueColor` enum. For more information, see the [Card Microcharts](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/features/microcharts) section in the Card Explorer.

-   We have allowed the usage of time series charts in the Analytical card. To enable this feature, we now pass the dimensions’ `dataType` parameter in the manifest. For more information, see the [Column with Time Axis](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/analytical/timeAxis) sample in the Card Explorer.

-   We have added documentation and a sample about intent-based navigation actions. Intent-based navigation is a mechanism, which has to be supported by the host environment, that allows you to launch applications or perform actions on semantic objects by using abstract intents. For more information, see the [Navigation](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/actions/navigation) section and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/cardActions/ibn) in the Card Explorer.
