**Reminder: Outdated SAPUI5 Versions to Be Removed from the CDN**

For security reasons, SAPUI5 versions that are no longer maintained will be removed from the UI5 content delivery network \(CDN\) one year after their end of maintenance. If a version is still in maintenance, patches of that version that are older than one year will also be removed. We have noted that a number of customers are still using such outdated versions or patches. If this affects you, please note that once these versions or patches are removed, your applications will break. Please update to a more recent version or patch. For more information, see: [Removing Outdated UI5 Versions from UI5 CDN](https://blogs.sap.com/2021/01/26/removing-outdated-ui5-versions-from-ui5-cdn/) as well as the UI5 notifications in the Demo Kit.

**Object Pages: Data Entry No Longer Blocked by Busy Indicator**

In certain cases, a busy indicator unnecessarily prevents the user from entering data in object page forms. We will remove the busy indicator in these cases so that data entry is possible.

## Improved Features


<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**Spreadsheet Export**

We have provided the following new features that are dependent on user information in the SAP Fiori launchpad:

-   Specific date and time formats, such as formats taken from calendars other than the Gregorian calendar and some related calendar settings, are now taken into account during the spreadsheet export.

-   You can now view information about the creation time and the relevant user in exported spreadsheets and PDF documents if you select *Include filter settings* in the *Export As* dialog.


For more information, see [Spreadsheet Export](../04_Essentials/spreadsheet-export-2691788.md) and the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.export.Spreadsheet/overview).

## Improved Controls


<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

<code><b>sap.m.Link</b></code>

We have provided a new API in the control, and now app developers can change the control's role to `button` when it's used for triggering a function.

 For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.Link). 



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**`sap.ui.integration.widgets.Card`**

-   We have \(experimentally\) enabled the possibility for a shared JavaScript library to be used as an extension by multiple cards. As a card developer, you can set this extension via the manifest. For more information, see the [Card Extension](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/features/extension) section and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/extension/sharedExtension) in the Card Explorer.

-   We have made the loading placeholders for Table and Object cards more detailed to better reveal the expected loading content. For more information, see the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.integration.widgets.Card/sample/sap.ui.integration.sample.LazyLoading).

-   We have \(experimentally\) introduced the possibility for ComboBox or TextArea form inputs to be used inside the Object card. Afterwards, you can process and submit the data provided with these form inputs to a back-end service. For more information, see the [Object Card](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/typesDeclarative/object) section and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/object/form) in the Card Explorer.

-   The Object card \(experimentally\) supports custom error message when there is empty data retrieved from the back end. To enable this feature, we have added a new `hasData` property inside the `content` section of the manifest. Card developers should set this property to point to a chosen data attribute. At runtime, if a condition is met, the corresponding illustrated message is displayed. For more information, see the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/errorMessages/object).

## SAP Fiori Elements


<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

The following changes and new features are available for SAP Fiori elements for OData V2:

-   Applications can now specify the unbound action that is triggered on a target during external navigation. For more information, see [Handling of the preferredMode Parameter](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/handling-of-the-preferredmode-parameter-bfaf3cc.md).

-   You now have an option to define your own keyboard shortcuts for application-specific actions and navigation buttons. For more information, see [Keyboard Shortcuts](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/keyboard-shortcuts-0cd318c.md).

-   Applications can now show a custom message strip above the object page tables. For more information, see [Adding a Custom Message Strip to List Report, Analytical List Page and Object Page Tables](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/adding-a-custom-message-strip-to-list-report-analytical-list-page-and-object-page-tables-0fdbefb.md).

-   In the object page tables, you can now prepopulate the default empty rows with a value using `DefaultValuesFunction`. For more information, see [Enabling Inline Creation Mode or Empty Rows Mode for Table Entries](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/enabling-inline-creation-mode-or-empty-rows-mode-for-table-entries-cfb04f0.md) and [Prefilling Fields Using the DefaultValuesFunction](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/prefilling-fields-using-the-defaultvaluesfunction-5ada91c.md).

-   Applications can now define the list of specific semantic object actions that are displayed in the related apps list. For more information, see [Enabling the Related Apps Button](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/enabling-the-related-apps-button-8dcfe2e.md).




</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

The following changes and new features are available for SAP Fiori elements for OData V4:

-   Applications can now turn off the confirmation popup for discarding a draft for external navigation. For more information, see [Confirmation Popups](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/confirmation-popups-9a53662.md).

-   Quick views are now supported for a source property without a `ReferentialConstraint`. For more information, see [Enabling Quick Views for Link Navigation](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/enabling-quick-views-for-link-navigation-307ced1.md).
