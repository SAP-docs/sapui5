**SAPUI5 Bootstrapping**

For all long-term maintenance versions of SAPUI5 starting from 1.71, you can now use evergreen versions in the bootstrap script. The script takes care to boot your SAPUI5 application from CDN with a specific version using the latest patch level. Additionally, all HTML pages of the Demo Kit using evergreen versions will be automatically redirected. For more information, see [Bootstrapping from SAPUI5 CDN](../04_Essentials/variant-for-bootstrapping-from-content-delivery-network-2d3eb2f.md#loio2d3eb2f322ea4a82983c1c62a33ec4ae__section_CDN).

For more information, see the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/extension/showMessage) in the Card Explorer.

-   We have introduced a new `initials` formatter, which creates initials from names. The default length of the returned initials is 2, but you can control it using the optional `length` property. For more information, see the [Initials Formatter](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/formatters/initials) section and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/initials) in the Card Explorer.

-   We have added a new [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/encodeURIComponent) that demonstrates how you can use expression binding with `EncodeURIComponent` formatter. Expression binding also supports some of the native JS functions like `Array`, `Boolean`, `Date`, `Infinity`, `isFinite`, `isNaN`, `JSON`, `Math`, `NaN`, `Number`, `Object`, `parseFloat`, `parseInt`, `RegExp`, `String`, and `undefined`.
