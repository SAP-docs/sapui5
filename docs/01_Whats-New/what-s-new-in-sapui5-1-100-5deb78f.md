**Reminder: Outdated SAPUI5 Versions to Be Removed from the CDN**

For security reasons, SAPUI5 versions that are no longer maintained will be removed from the UI5 content delivery network \(CDN\) one year after their end of maintenance. If a version is still in maintenance, patches of that version that are older than one year will also be removed. We have noted that a number of customers are still using such outdated versions or patches. If this affects you, please note that once these versions or patches are removed, your applications will break. Please update to a more recent version or patch. For more information, see: [Removing Outdated UI5 Versions from UI5 CDN](https://blogs.sap.com/2021/01/26/removing-outdated-ui5-versions-from-ui5-cdn/) as well as the UI5 notifications in the Demo Kit.

## Improved Features


<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**SAPUI5 Bootstrapping**

For all long-term maintenance versions of SAPUI5 starting from 1.71, you can now use evergreen versions in the bootstrap script. The script takes care to boot your SAPUI5 application from CDN with a specific version using the latest patch level. Additionally, all HTML pages of the Demo Kit using evergreen versions will be automatically redirected. For more information, see [Bootstrapping from SAPUI5 CDN](../04_Essentials/variant-for-bootstrapping-from-content-delivery-network-2d3eb2f.md#loio2d3eb2f322ea4a82983c1c62a33ec4ae__section_CDN).



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**SAPUI5 OData V2 Model**

You can now access the status of a `Context` in bindings with the `@$ui5.context.isInactive` and `@$ui5.context.isTransient` instance annotations.For more information, see the [API Reference for `#isInactive`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v2.Context%23methods/isInactive) and the [API Reference for `#isTransient`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v2.Context%23methods/isTransient).



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

The new version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model introduces the following features:

-   The `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel#getKeepAliveContext` method introduced with SAPUI5 1.99 also works if either no context exists in the identified list binding or if no list binding could be identified at all.For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel%23methods/getKeepAliveContext) and [Relative Bindings](../04_Essentials/data-reuse-648e360.md#loio648e360fa22d46248ca783dc6eb44531__section_relativeBindings).

-   You can now refresh a list binding with transient records.

## Improved Controls


<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**`sap.m.QuickView`**

Тhe control now displays a language-dependent “–” symbol when the text for a value is empty. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.QuickView) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.m.QuickViewCard/sample/sap.m.sample.QuickViewCard).



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**`sap.m.Select`**

The `sap.m.Select` control has a new `liveChange` event that fires when the user navigates to a different item.For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.Select).



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

`SmartField` in edit mode now supports time zones for `Edm.DateTimeOffset` fields with the following annotation

```
<Annotation Term="com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.Timezone" Path="ClockInTimezone"/>
```

You can format the date in the `sap.ui.core.CustomData` class with `key:“dateFormatSettings”`. If you add the `"showTimezone": "Hide"` property to `sap.ui.core.CustomData`, the time zone will not be shown.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**`sap.ui.comp.smartfilterbar.SmartFilterBar`**

For more information, see the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/extension/showMessage) in the Card Explorer.

-   We have introduced a new `initials` formatter, which creates initials from names. The default length of the returned initials is 2, but you can control it using the optional `length` property. For more information, see the [Initials Formatter](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/formatters/initials) section and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/initials) in the Card Explorer.

-   We have added a new [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/encodeURIComponent) that demonstrates how you can use expression binding with `EncodeURIComponent` formatter. Expression binding also supports some of the native JS functions like `Array`, `Boolean`, `Date`, `Infinity`, `isFinite`, `isNaN`, `JSON`, `Math`, `NaN`, `Number`, `Object`, `parseFloat`, `parseInt`, `RegExp`, `String`, and `undefined`.
