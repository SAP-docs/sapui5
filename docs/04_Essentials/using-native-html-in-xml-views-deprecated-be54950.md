# Using Native HTML in XML Views \(deprecated\)

The use of native HTML in XML views depends on the XHTML feature set.



## Context

> ### Caution:  
> Deprecated as of SAPUI5 version 1.120. Consider either using `sap.ui.core.HTML` or creating a notepad control instead, both of which can be used in your XML view.

When mixing XHTML and SAPUI5 controls, observe the following rules:

-   XHTML elements can be used instead of the SAPUI5 type control, for example, in the root of an XML view or in the content aggregation of a layout container.

-   When embedding XHTML in an aggregation of a SAPUI5 control, the XHTML must not consist of a single text node. The topmost node of an embedded XHTML tree must be an XHTML element. Embedding pure text into an aggregation is not supported.

-   The XHTML nodes are converted 1:1 to HTML, the XML view does not deal with any differences between XHTML and HTML \(for example rewriting and auto-closing tags\)

-   The created HTML DOM nodes are preserved during re-rendering of an XML view: Modifications to the DOM are not lost.


> ### Note:  
> As an alternative to embedding XHTML, you can use the `sap.ui.core.HTML` control. As this requires content encoding it is, however, less convenient.

> ### Note:  
> Native XHTML can't be used in the binding template for a bound aggregation \(e.g., the `content` aggregation\) of the XML view.



## Procedure

To mix SAPUI5 controls with native XHTML, you only need the XHTML namespace to use \(X\)HTML:

```xml
<mvc:View controllerName="module:sap/hcm/Address" xmlns="sap.m" xmlns:mvc="sap.ui.core.mvc"
           xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <Panel>
      <Button text="Press Me. I am an SAPUI5 Button"/>
      <html:button>No, press me. I am native HTML Button.</html:button>
   </Panel>
</mvc:View>
```
