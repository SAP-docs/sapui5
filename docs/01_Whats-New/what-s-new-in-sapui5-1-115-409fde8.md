**Introduction of `sap.ui.mdc` library \(experimental\)**

We have introduced the `sap.ui.mdc` library experimentally. This library contains smart composite controls that are metadata-driven and allow applications to use them with any SAPUI5 model and any data protocol. For more information, see [sap.ui.mdc](../10_More_About_Controls/sap-ui-mdc-1dd2aa9.md) and the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.mdc).

**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model**

The new version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model introduces the following features:

-   You can now close the current changeset in `Auto` groups by calling `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel#submitBatch`. For any additional change requests that are created afterwards and make it into the same `$batch` request, a new changeset is created.

    For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel/methods/submitBatch).

-   We now support the "Deep Create" scenario for navigation properties of cardinality "many", that is, collection-valued navigation properties.

    For more information, see [Creating an Entity](../04_Essentials/creating-an-entity-c9723f8.md).

**SAPUI5 OData Types**

The new version of SAPUI5 provides the `parseEmptyValueToZero` format option for the following numeric OData types:

-   `sap.ui.model.odata.type.Byte`
-   `sap.ui.model.odata.type.Decimal`
-   `sap.ui.model.odata.type.Double`
-   `sap.ui.model.odata.type.Int`
-   `sap.ui.model.odata.type.Int16`
-   `sap.ui.model.odata.type.Int32`
-   `sap.ui.model.odata.type.Int64`
-   `sap.ui.model.odata.type.SByte`
-   `sap.ui.model.odata.type.Single`

Empty input, that is, `null` or `""`, is parsed to 0 if `parseEmptyValueToZero` is set to `true` and if the `nullable` constraint is `false`.

For more information, see, for example, the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.type.Int16) for `sap.ui.model.odata.type.Int16`.

**`sap.ui.integration.widgets.Card`**

-   Using the new \(experimental\) `modelSizeLimit` property, you can set the maximum number of entries that are used for all list bindings inside the card. This feature is important for cards that use forms and filters. The default `modelSizeLimit` value is 1000. For more information, see the [Integration Card Configuration](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/configuration) section and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/data/modelSizeLimit) in the Card Explorer.

-   We have \(experimentally\) introduced a new input field in the Object Card that enables the users to pick a date.

    For more information, see the [Object Card](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/typesDeclarative/object) section and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/object/form) in the Card Explorer.

-   We have introduced a new `showColon` property for labels in the Object Card. When set to `false` it hides the colons. The default value is `true`, in which case all colons are automatically shown. For more information, see the [Object Card](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/typesDeclarative/object) section and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/object/form) in the Card Explorer.

-   For OData V4: `DigitalSequence`
