# Using SAPUI5 Flexibility

You can use SAPUI5 flexibility to extend your SAP Fiori apps.



SAPUI5 flexibility allows you to extend freestyle SAPUI5 or SAP Fiori elements applications without modifications of base artefacts. To use this type of extensibility, you have different options:

-   **Key User Adaptation**

    Key user adaptation allows you to make UI changes at runtime, for example, adding and removing fields, setting default views, renaming and rearranging elements, and embedding content.

    For an overview of features, see [Key User Adaptation](https://help.sap.com/docs/UI5_FLEXIBILITY/430e2c1a4ff241bc8162df4bf51e0730/328a550137344514ae085b924180d078.html).

    For information on how to use key user adaptation, see [Adapting SAP Fiori UIs at Runtime - Key User Adaptation](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/4fc8d03390c342da8a60f8ee387bca1a/5c424437bf794f809087fdce391149f2.html).

-   **Developer Adaptation**

    Developer adaptation needs an adaptation project in SAP Business Application Studio. It allows you to make changes that are also available in key user adaptation, as well as to extend views with XML fragments, extend controllers with controller extensions, replace or add an OData service, add annotations, and more.

    For an overview of features, see [Developer Adaptation](https://help.sap.com/docs/UI5_FLEXIBILITY/430e2c1a4ff241bc8162df4bf51e0730/a3e9d764dc8841468f73fd7cabc07cec.html).
